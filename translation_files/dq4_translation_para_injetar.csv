0x0001|The door is tightly closed...
0x0002|Lucia: <HERO>! And everyone! I'm proud to have been able to travel with you.
0x0003|{7f30} “Ggogorn!
0x0004|Did you guys defeat the second Emperor of Hell? That was crazy!
0x0005|Goggone Goggone.
0x0006|thank you very much. Now I won't have to watch people suffer anymore.
0x0007|oh! Everything is God's guidance!
0x0008|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x0009|Manya: Well, the final battle might have been a little dangerous without me.
0x000A|Alina: ``I really wanted to show you our deadly battle with the Emperor of Hell!''
0x000B|Ryan: ``I think the reason we were able to return home alive from the final battle was because we all worked together.
0x000C|Manya: Lucia has started saying stubborn things like, ``I'm proud of you.''
0x000D|Ryan: Now that we've completed our mission, I feel like I won't be able to see Lucia like I used to.
0x000E|Alina: ``I'll give Despisaro a handicap. At most, I hope he evolves in the depths of the earth!''
0x000F|Torneko: "Hey, Despisaro is trying to evolve! That's a big deal. Torneko: If we wait too long, we'll have to fight something like Estarc again. My father was killed just after he created the mysterious secret method of teaching. Manya: If that's the case, as long as we don't destroy the secret method of evolution, then the attack is over. I can't say it.
0x0010|Minea: The secret of evolution created by my father is now in Despisaro's hands and he is abusing it.
0x0011|Ryan: Let's use the secret of evolution to make Despisaro a dead man.
0x0012|Minea: Lucia looks ladylike for some reason when she's with the Skyling. Is she wearing a cat hat?
0x0013|Clift: ``She was conspicuous during her journey, but when the only Skylings around her are Lucia-san, she seems normal.''
0x0014|Ryan: ``As expected, Lucia doesn't talk to me as casually as before with the other Skylings.
0x0015|Manya: Well, Lucia has become quite aloof since she came here.
0x0016|Arena: Since it's a dragon, {7f30}'s scales must be hard and tough. Arena: If that's the case, you might not need to wear any armor.
0x0017|Minea: Unfortunately, {7f30} is not a guided person, but he is definitely a valuable force.
0x0018|Bligh: ``Well, Dragon. Now that I've come here, I've made another strong friend.
0x0019|Manya: {7f30}Oh... Maybe if we let him dance on the Montbarbara stage, he might become popular.
0x001A|It is a seedling of the world tree that was grown by Daiji.
0x001B|<HERO>Ya. Even though you don't have a father or mother, you have such wonderful friends... Everyone, please be friends with <HERO> forever. …………………. Oh, I hope you're doing well, even though you're so weird.
0x001C|Take a look! Look! Look at the happy faces of the people on the ground!
0x001D|You did it! ? I reviewed it!
0x001E|Manya: Half of us are celestial beings, but our HERO friends who grew up on earth are like us earthlings.
0x001F|Alina: ``Hero and I have been best friends ever since we met!'' Alina: ``That's why you should come visit us at Santheim.
0x0020|Ryan: Is it just my imagination? That woman looks like <HERO>... No, it's just my imagination.
0x0021|Minea: <HERO> and I are similar in that we don't have a father.
0x0022|Torneko: Hate? I heard a very similar story somewhere.
0x0023|Manya: Hey, according to this story, doesn't that mean <HERO>'s mother is still alive?
0x0024|Clift: One thing is clear: <HERO>'s father is dead and no longer in this world. Clift: Oh, I'm sorry. I blurted it out...

Even though you're a woman, you've done your best." Master Dragon: "Bly and Clift helped Alina, too. If I look at you now, my father will surely be impressed.

0x003B|Reese: Hey, from now on, we'll be together.

0x0058|.
0x0059|There was an old dragon school. ! It was written in ``Reton''. Today, it was written as ``Reiko Niiyo, who will use Doran's birth and defeat''.
0x005A|Romo Tagoradon is here.
0x005B|There was a diary of Tenkujin. ! It was written in a letter that said, ``No matter how hard I try, the Master Dragon will not let go of her who has committed a crime and fallen to the ground.'' Now, the Master Dragon will destroy her happiness in the most cruel way.A tragedy will ensue.

0x0060|Manya: Hey, not only <HERO>, but also my name has been properly added to history.
0x0061|I guess so?

0x006A|Alina: “Finally, there are good people too.”
0x006B|I got the elf to understand.
0x006C|Let's go
0x006D|Mother's love is said to be a hero who overcomes evil.
0x006E|That seems annoying.
0x006F|Arena: “I see, <HERO> is here.
0x0070|Then I returned to earth.
0x0071|Futobe “Hello”
0x0072|Ryan: Return to Earth
0x0073|However, what kind of <HERO> is this?
0x0074|……. Ryan: If you don't mind, join me in the band.
0x0075|Kokakido Tanaka? La hey

0x0083|Bly: “As expected, it was Sansurii.
0x0084|I wonder if those people are the ones who live in the world of darkness.

0x0090|Yomoru... In the world of upper darkness, there are hands
0x0091|Don't get out of there! hand
0x0092|Maybe it's crazy.
0x0093|Minea: Now? Edorerama will surely join us in our battle.
0x0094|My name is Tatama.
0x0095|Tasudo Nikia?
0x0096|A floating monkey
0x0097|That alone is surprising.

0x00A1|Arena: ``This time, I'll finally turn into a bully.
0x00A2|<HERO>What do you want to eat when you are in the sky? I went and lost my job.
0x00A3|Modoko
0x00A4|That's the place where human blood was flowing! Okay, I've been on earth for a long time.

0x00AA|Bijanai <HERO>. That and Su
0x00AB|I just called you a hero!
0x00AC|Ryan: <HERO>It's a shame that the Skyman doesn't have wings.
0x00AD|Clift: When Estark wakes up and comes to the surface, now...
0x00AE|too. It's going to be a big deal.
0x00AF|Arena: “We are Estark.
0x00B0|Is it because Rabashi's evolution of Estark was incomplete? Arena: “That’s not fun. I want to fight the full version of Estark!
0x00B1|Ryan: ``I was able to defeat Estark, but now I'm trying to become Uzegoso.''
0x00B2|.
0x00B3|Torneko “The Secret of Evolution”
0x00B4|Should. I'll knock down the seal and destroy it.
0x00B5|I don't think it's small.
0x00B6|Bligh: ``Apparently, the secret of evolution is that no matter how long you seal it or not, it will take a long time.''
0x00B7|As many times as you like
0x00B8|and others…
0x00B9|It seems like a thing.
0x00BA|Manya: ``I've learned a little bit from the secret of evolution.''
0x00BB|Let's see Ryan. If you use the secret of evolution,
0x00BC|If you are a hard worker, you will evolve into a hard worker.
0x00BD|I wonder if it is?
0x00BE|Minea: “My father wants it.”
0x00BF|! Rimo
0x00C0|If not, we will have the secret of evolution.
0x00C1|My life was stolen without a trace
0x00C2|Even though it didn't happen.
0x00C3|Alina: “Do elves hate humans? Come to think of it, the elves at the Twitter Tower also ran away when they saw me.
0x00C4|Tagtakka.
0x00C5|Torneko: “Don’t listen to my mouth.”
0x00C6|At the end
0x00C7|I don't want Ryan to get angry even though I'm going to sleep.
0x00C8|That's the feeling. Torneko: “If Mr. Panon is here,
0x00C9|Wase
0x00CA|I can do things
0x00CB|Nanaa.
0x00CC|Minea: “What a cute elf. My older sister when I was a child.”
0x00CD|Rodero
0x00CE|Manya: Kochi: Ten... It's an elf. Shall I punish you?
0x00CF|A horse-drawn carriage and balloons are waiting outside.
0x00D0|Are you going to go? Please take care!
0x00D1|Even though he doesn't have wings, he can defeat the Emperor of Hell! I can't believe it!
0x00D2|Awesome! Awesome! Hey, come live here with us!
0x00D3|Oh <HERO>! You are the true hero!
0x00D4|Arena: The best choice for a wingless HERO is to return to earth with us!
0x00D5|Ryan: After completing our mission, it seems that the Skylings have finally recognized the <HERO> as our own kind.
0x00D6|Manya: ``Oh, you've missed the view overlooking from this castle.'' Manya: ``The reason we entered the castle in the sky was because we were on a mission to destroy the second Emperor of Hell.
0x00D7|Alina: ``I might never be able to come again, so I'll make sure to burn this view into my eyes!''
0x00D8|Ryan: ``I, a mighty warrior, am standing here in a mysterious castle floating in the sky.'' Ryan: ``Just thinking about that alone makes me feel warm.''
0x00D9|Torneko: ``I just looked through the hole above the ground, and it was incredibly high.'' Torneko: ``I hope it doesn't fall to the ground and break into pieces.
0x00DA|Arena: Wait, Despisaro! Now, quickly, let's jump out of the hole and go to the world of darkness!
0x00DB|Clift: ``I don't like it...I guess the only way to get to the dark world is to jump into that hole.''
0x00DC|Minea: “Is the attack caused by the waves just now a provocation to lure us into a trap?”
0x00DD|Bligh: Since we have enough time to attack the castle, Despisarro may have successfully achieved the ultimate evolution.
0x00DE|Ryan: ``I see. Don't the people in the sky know what an earthquake is?
0x00DF|Clift: Even if the castle doesn't budge, there's still a hole in the clouds... Clift: If the evil wave were to penetrate the clouds beneath our feet, it would fall head over heels on the ground!
0x00E0|Clift: Wow... Is the evil one actually Despisarro?
0x00E1|Arena: Wait, Despisaro! It seems like we were destined to fight someday ever since the martial arts tournament.
0x00E2|Manya: Well, no matter what happens on the ground, you might be safe if you stay here. Manya: I don't want to have nowhere to go back to, so let's go quickly and exterminate the evil one.
0x00E3|Ryan: True peace will never come unless we meet Despisaro, who has obtained the secret of evolution.
0x00E4|Alina: If I had wings, I could fly all the way here without having to climb that boring tower in the sky.
0x00E5|Clift: Do sky people have longer lifespans than us?
0x00E6|Manya: Since humans have come here for the first time in hundreds of years, it would be nice if they could throw us a party.
0x00E7|Bligh: It's been hundreds of years. Even though we don't live for even 100 years...
0x00E8|Minea: I hope Lucia doesn't get punished for dropping the Sword of the Sky...
0x00E9|Alina: ``My arms are weak, but if Lucia had trained, she could have become as strong as me.'' Alina: ``It would be a waste to stop traveling here.
0x00EA|Clift: ``It's not until they're gone that you realize how good a person is.'' Clift: ``No, Lucia was a good girl even when we were together.''
0x00EB|Manya: ``Lucia is a nice girl, but her sensibilities are a little different from the rest of us.'' Manya: ``Well, it can't be helped since she grew up in a place like this.''
0x00EC|Ryan: ``It's sad to think we're saying goodbye here. I should have spent more time with Lucia.''
0x00ED|Manya: ``I'm sure if you could make Skyman dance at the theater in Montbarbara, you'd become a star in no time.''
0x00EE|Torneko: ``It's pretty spectacular. Everyone who lives here has wings, just like Lucia.''
0x00EF|Bligh: ``It's so hot! It's so hot! The wind is touching my bones.''
0x00F0|Clift: Is this castle okay? I wonder if it will slip through the base of the cloud and fall to the ground...
0x00F1|Alina: ``The air is really thin. I think I can improve my stamina by training my body here!
0x00F2|Ryan: ``Now that I think about it, I've come a long way.I never thought I'd come here as a warrior.''
0x00F3|Minea: It was because of <HERO>'s guidance that someone like me was able to enter the castle in the sky.
0x00F4|There is a book called ``History of Butland''. I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Batrea, the founder of Batland, protected Battland from monsters when it was still just a village. At that time, it is said that Batrea was able to protect herself from all kinds of monster attacks with the shield given to her by the god of heaven...
0x00F5|It is a landscape painting depicting mountains in spring.
0x00F6|There are delicious-looking dishes lined up on the table.
0x00F7|There is a theological book called ``Faith and Prayer.'' It seems like something is stuck between the books. A hidden bromide of the arena has appeared!
0x00F8|A portrait of the deceased Queen Santheim is hung here.
0x00F9|The mountains of Santheim territory are vividly depicted.
0x00FA|It looked like it was in disrepair as it had only been repaired with a board. Do you want to hide the wall?
0x00FB|It looks like they are repairing the hole with a board.

0x0782|Hmm, what on earth is that... oh! Are you a traveler? This is Gotside, the town closest to the sky. A large hole suddenly opened in this town's altar. That's God's judgment, no.
0x0783|Gako Toruneko himself. "We don't even know.
0x0784|Even if you climb the tower to the sky, not everyone will be able to reach the sky. According to an old book, only those who have acquired all the weapons and armor of the sky are eligible.
0x0785|I heard that somewhere on this island there is a tower that leads to the sky.
0x0786|I am the one who hears the voice of God. I was also the one who heard the prophecy that Estark would be resurrected and a hero would defeat him. Everything is as God predicted. Yes, you may come to this god side. However, I can't hear anything at all after Estarc is defeated... O God of the sky! What on earth are you saying?
0x0787|I understand. Despizarro only has hatred in his heart! I have to stop it soon! Before Despisaro evolves into a horribly evil person...
0x0788|Oh my God! If you use the Golden Bracelet, the secret of evolution will become even more terrifying than the old one.
0x0789|Rumor has it that Despisaro went deep into the earth and began using secret techniques.
0x078A|The forbidden secret of evolution...
0x078B|It was going to be a big deal. It seems that a demon named Despisaro has finally perfected the secret of evolution.
0x078C|It seems that Estark, who was resurrected from hell, was defeated by the hero as predicted. But now, the second Estark is about to be born!
0x078D|Deep sorrow will eventually turn a person's heart into darkness. However, when we were born into this world, we were all surrounded by .
0x078E|Farewell to the missing. life and death. Despair and hope. Everything is God's guidance. Go forward without fear. God is always watching over you.
0x078F|This is Gotside, the town closest to the sky. Traveler, are you aiming for the sky? Or...
0x0790|Ryan: ``He's a tough-minded old man. That's why it's better than his age.''
0x0791|Torneko: “Ah...eyeball
0x0792|- Narere de Fu... Brii! ! I'm hungry.
0x0793|Manya: ``That's right. After all, you won't believe it until you see it.''
0x0794|Pissarro: ``...Hmm. Women tend to talk nonsense.
0x0795|Clift: ``If I lost someone I love, I might curse the world. Clift: ``However, I don't think there's any chance of him dying in a rare case.''
0x0796|Manya: “Ah, I wish I had a lover who would love me that much too!”
0x0797|Pizarro: "A second Estarc? Hmm. I am myself. I have nothing to do with Estarc.
0x0798|Torneko: ``He has such a pretty face, but he talks scary things. Oh, that's scary.''
0x0799|Bligh: Is there anything scary about this Bligh? Hmm. That's right. Bligh: Well, I guess it's frightening to see how strong the princess can become.
0x079A|Clift: That's right. Well, Clift. Well, Clift. I have to try as hard as I can. Clift: "...Yes! Let's do our best. Our hope is pretty slim, but it's probably not zero.
0x079B|Alina: ``I wonder what kind of guidance it is that the place it is led to is covered in chickens.''
0x079C|Torneko: Until now, this town didn't have anything special, but now we can attract an audience!
0x079D|Manya: ``I was planning on using that altar as a stage someday!'' Manya: ``What the hell is that guy from? That's disgusting.
0x079E|Ryan: It's good to improve your skills, but don't forget your role in saving the world.
0x079F|Bligh: I had so many things to do one after another, I was really tired!
0x07A0|Clift: If you're going to go to the bottom of the altar again, please make sure you're properly prepared.
0x07A1|Arena: “Eggla and Chiquila were so crisp and crunchy! It was a fun battle!
0x07A2|Torneko: “Hmm, I really feel like eating an omelet right now!
0x07A3|Minea: In the end, who made the hole in the altar? Maybe it was because of that volcano.
0x07A4|Manya: “I had no idea that this town was connected to the chicken space.
0x07A5|Bligh: "The god of the sky means that master dragon? Bligh: Hmm. So, we actually talked to the god directly! I'm surprised that it's so late.
0x07A6|Minea: ``...I can hear a voice calling us from the bottom of the hole in the altar.''
0x07A7|Manya: Why don't you go check it out yourself before you make such a fuss? Manya: Well, an old man doesn't have any money!
0x07A8|Clift: If I lose someone I love, I too might curse the world. Clift: But time won't go back. The dead won't come back to life... I feel sorry for Despisaro too.
0x07A9|Alina: Well, Despizarro may be a pitiful person, too. Alina: But that doesn't mean I can forgive him for trying to destroy humans.
0x07AA|Manya: ``That's right, Despizarro had a lover, even though he was dead.... Tsk.
0x07AB|Bligh: ``It's very difficult. Oh, it's very difficult.'' It's almost time for you to hear how difficult it is.
0x07AC|Manya: “The people of this town seemed to act like they were okay no matter what happened. That's surprising.
0x07AD|Ryan: ``That's why priests are like women. It's a shame.'' Ryan: ``No, I'm not talking about Clift or anything.
0x07AE|Alina: ``You're so sloppy. If you were a man, you could just climb up there and take a quick look.''
0x07AF|Torneko: ``You're such a small-minded person. If I drag you to the top of the altar, you might lose consciousness.''
0x07B0|Ryan: "Whether it's a god or a monster, we can't allow anything that disturbs people's hearts.
0x07B1|Clift: I hear that monsters are at their most powerful on full moon nights. So, the altar too...?
0x07B2|Manya: “Oh, did you hear that? Hey, I’m kidding!
0x07B3|Minea: “...Sister! Stop making up stories!
0x07B4|Manya: The other night under the crescent moon. When I woke up in the middle of the night in the inn, I saw something horrifying! Manya: Minea was sitting upright on the bed, giggling! Oh, that was scary.
0x07B5|Torneko: ``He has such a pretty face, but he talks scary things. Oh, that's scary.''
0x07B6|Minea: So far, I've never had a single prediction come true. If that's the case, I'm sure the next one will be too...
0x07B7|Bligh: Is there anything scary about this Bligh? Hmm. That's right. Bligh: Well, I guess it's frightening to see how strong the princess can become.
0x07B8|Clift: That's right. Before you give up on anything, you have to try as hard as you can. Clift: Yeah! Let's do our best. My hope is pretty slim, but maybe it's not zero.
0x07B9|Alina: ``I wonder why I'm hearing all these incomprehensible sermons.'' Alina: ``Well, in the first place, the path that isn't difficult is boring, and you just move on.''
0x07BA|Torneko: Until now, this town didn't have anything special, but now we can attract an audience!
0x07BB|Minea: I understand. Either way, we are being called...
0x07BC|Manya: ``I was planning on using that altar as a stage someday!'' Manya: ``What the hell is that guy from? That's disgusting.
0x07BD|Ryan: ``If the path is opened to me, I'll just move forward. I won't hesitate.''
0x07BE|Bligh: I had so many things to do one after another, I was really tired!
0x07BF|Clift: A new presence has appeared in this town... It's strange. A power that can't be found in the darkness. Clift: God, please listen to the people of this town.
0x07C0|Alina: ``Anything is fine. I want to fight strong opponents and become even stronger!Alina: I don't care if it's the world of darkness or the sky, it doesn't matter, let's go quickly.
0x07C1|Torneko "Town's
0x07C2|I can smell the mask from all directions! Torneko: ``I'm sure about it. Let's go now!''
0x07C3|Minea: "I can hear you... I'm calling you..." Now, let's go to the altar! Minea: "Oh!? Did I just say something strange? That's strange.
0x07C4|Manya: ``There's something strange about everyone. It's unusual for everyone to be so nervous.''
0x07C5|Lucia: Of course we, the people of the sky, can travel freely, but there are many different types of people on the ground.
0x07C6|Clift: I can't wear a weapon in the sky anyway, so I can't wait on the ground... Clift: Is it no good? That's right, it's no good. Ah, it must be expensive...
0x07C7|Arena: “It was boring with the balloons because the enemies were so crowded, but with the towers you can fight like crazy!
0x07C8|Torneko: As expected of the weapons and armor of the sky. They're worthy of becoming legends. Yeah, yeah.
0x07C9|Manya: ``If you want to check your appearance, then you can buy new clothes and accessories.
0x07CA|Lucia: That's right! It's this island! There's a tower that leads to the castle in the sky!
0x07CB|Clift: A tower... A tower to the sky... Just thinking about it makes me dizzy.
0x07CC|Minea: You mean the tower to the sky that Lucia-san was talking about.
0x07CD|Ryan: ``Well, it's hard to understand what that person is saying. It's okay. I just need to move forward.''
0x07CE|Bligh: “Believe in your own power more than in prophecy. Just like me! Hohohoho.
0x07CF|Clift: Even with the powers of God, we can't know the fate of the world. I'm worried. Clift: At least the princess will go to a safe place...I don't think she'll allow that. Haaa.
0x07D0|Alina: It's natural that you can't hear anything. Because it's already clear to you. Alina: Thanks to us, all the bad guys will be defeated and the world will be at peace! Huh?
0x07D1|Torneko: If God were to know, could he predict all the results of the casino?
0x07D2|Manya: ``...If the god of the sky knew, I would have been able to defeat it myself.'' Manya: ``I've worked so hard. It won't be worth it if I don't get a lot of rewards!''
0x07D3|Minea: If all of our journeys so far have been guided by God, then there is definitely hope. Minea: We have met and become friends. We are no longer alone.
0x07D4|Ryan: ``The stronger the enemy, the more worth fighting for. I feel more motivated.''
0x07D5|Clift: Isn't there a way to stop Despisarro other than fighting?...Well, it's impossible.
0x07D6|Alina: Hatred? It's all about me! If it's hatred, even I can't lose! Alina: The hatred that took away my father and everyone in the castle. I'll bring it down on Despisaro!
0x07D7|Bligh: "That's why I should have just left Flenor alone, being a fake! I grumbled...
0x07D8|Alina: The golden bracelet I gave you in exchange for Mei... Well, I can't help but think about it! Alina: My strength is no longer a strength. I have to be at least a little handicapped.
0x07D9|Manya: Is that the golden bracelet that your father wrote about in his book a long time ago?
0x07DA|Lucia: ``Despisaro...'' I wonder if the Dragon God understands this?
0x07DB|Bly: Hmph! I guess he realized that he couldn't win against us unless he cheated using the secret of evolution.
0x07DC|Minea: “The sky is
0x07DD|The source of power. The depths of the earth are the source of evil. That's what I'm told.
0x07DE|Ryan: ``Despisaro, who uses the secrets of evolution, must be formidable. Hehehehehehehehehehehehehehehehe, I guess it was my fault that Frenor stole my golden bracelet...''Clift: ``God, please forgive me for my helplessness.''
0x07DF|Manya: What's important here is Despisaro's face. Oh! I wonder what will happen to that beautiful figure. Manya: Look, the secret of evolution will make you ugly, right? What do you think? I'm curious.
0x07E0|Alina: Let alone a second Estark, if I can get 10 or even 20 of them, I'm all for it! Alina: And I'll make a carpet to fill the castle with Estark's fur!
0x07E1|Torneko: "The rumors about the hero are echoing all the way to this town. Hmmm. Torneko: "The hero's bromide... That's also true. Let's think about it for a moment.
0x07E2|Minea: The second Estark... It may be an even more formidable enemy than Estark.
0x07E3|Bligh: ``How dare you be a hero. There are many people who don't give up even when it's hard.'' Bligh: It's a sin to turn to the path of evil. This old man thinks it's just an escape.
0x07E4|Alina: “Oh yeah! Bly was definitely born with a wrinkled body.
0x07E5|Clift: ``But Mr. Bligh is rude.''
0x07E6|difference! I can't believe it was in my mind.
0x07E7|Manya: I'm always on stage in the dazzling light! I'm a top star after all.
0x07E8|Ryan: When I think about it, maybe the reason I'm traveling with Minato like this is God's guidance.
0x07E9|Alina: “…Well, in other words, if you sleep for now, the morning will come. Is that what it means?
0x07EA|Minea: In this town
0x07EB|So...I feel like if I fight, I can become an even better fortune teller.
0x07EC|Clift: I thought "Castle in the Sky" was a parable, but it turns out it's true.
0x07ED|Torneko: "Tenku Manju! Tenku Senbei! Tenku Monaka! Tenku Castella! Torneko: "Hmm, if you want to commercialize it, which one would you like first?
0x07EE|Manya: “Close to the sky? What are you talking about? It’s so low-lying!
0x07EF|Lucia: "Maybe it's just my imagination. I feel like I have a friend... Or maybe I'm not right?
0x07F0|Panon: “When I come to a quiet town like this, I can feel my comedian blood running through my veins!
0x07F1|Panon: "It seems like antiques are popular in this town. Eh? Why? Panon: "That's so cool! Cot... Psycho... Got..." Panon: "No, it's fine. Just pretend you didn't ask.
0x07F2|Listen.
0x07F3|Bligh: It's the unskilled who can't calm down unless it's a quiet place.
0x07F4|If only my youngest sister would become an expert
0x07F5|Even in a noisy casino, you can keep your mind together.
0x07F6|Bligh: I wonder if this dried-up tea-like fauna of this majestic town is alive! Bligh: I've heard it before. Somewhere in the world, there is someone who can hear the voice of heaven.
0x07F7|The tip of the tip is empty, isn't it? This fresh air. The faces of people shining with faith. Clift: ``It seems like it heals the hearts of those who are on a journey through battle.''
0x07F8|Arena: ``It's such a noisy place. It's perfect for a braai. It's Clift, Clift is empty here.''
0x07F9|Alina: ``If it were me, I'd want to feel it. I'd want to scream. I'd want to run. I'd like to fight. But...! Alina: ``Why are the people of this town so quiet? I can't believe it!
0x07FA|Torneko "Earth
0x07FB|Rusodo on. kinkinkin
0x07FC|...but there is no communication? Now is the time
0x07FD|Don't worry too much. Hmmm. Torneko: ``I want to monopolize the local specialties...or rather, I want to tour them as a sightseeing spot.''
0x07FE|Manya
0x07FF|Arusia's Kongakone Pigeon: ``Hmm. It's a stiff atmosphere. I don't like it. I'm not good at things like this. My back is starting to itch.
0x0800|Minea: I feel it. In this town, there are people just like me... people who hear the voices of non-human beings. Minea: The stars, the earth, the voices of heaven. I understand. We have been led to this town.
0x0801|Minea: “I feel like I feel at ease when I’m in this town. It’s strange.
0x0802|Lucia: I can feel it! There's definitely a tower in the sky near here!!
0x0803|Ryan: ``It just doesn't suit my skin.'' Ryan: ``Let's hurry up and finish our business!''
0x0804|Bligh: I once read in a book. Bligh: How terrible are those who hear the voice of God in the twilight.
0x0805|Clift “Church”
0x0806|An air of elegance and solemnity surrounds the entire town. Clift: Oh, God. Are you nearby?
0x0807|Alina: “There are a lot of people like Clift. We need to make sure we don’t make mistakes!
0x0808|Torneko: ``Mysterious town structure, mysterious buildings...What are the local specialties?''
0x0809|Manya: ``It's hard to do. Even though there are a lot of people, it's a pretty quiet town, isn't it?
0x080A|Minea: ``I feel the same way I felt when I saw the fortune telling.What the heck is going on here...''

0x0B76|{7f43}This is the tower to the sky. Only the chosen ones are allowed to climb... You unqualified person, leave!
0x0B77|A voice can be heard from everywhere...
0x0B78|Lucia: This tower is the Tower of the Sky. You can go to the Castle in the Sky from the top of this tower.
0x0B79|Minea: As expected, since it leads to the castle in the sky, anyone without qualifications will be turned away at the entrance.
0x0B7A|Manya: ``Wow, how tall it is. There's no way I could walk up a tower like this!''
0x0B7B|Torneko: Even if I look up from below, I have no idea where the top is.
0x0B7C|Clift: ``It's not a man-built tower, it has a sacred feel to it.
0x0B7D|Bligh: ``My neck hurts when I look up. This tower is so tall that it looks like it's leading to heaven.''
0x0B7E|Alina: ``The tower has been set up to prevent normal people from entering, which means the tower is full of monsters.
0x0B7F|Ryan: This tower feels a little different from the towers we've climbed up to now.

0x0BB3|Manya: ``Hmm, the wind feels nice. I've always loved high places like this. Manya: I just don't like climbing because it's tiring.
0x0BB4|Torneko: Even if a strong wind blows, my body won't be blown away easily.
0x0BB5|Clift: ``Hello. Even if there are handrails, I still don't like high places...''
0x0BB6|Bligh: ``...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

0x0C01|Lucia: “If you’ve come this far, you just have to try harder.
0x0C02|Minea: ``I'm so tired from coming this far that I don't have time to enjoy the scenery.
0x0C03|Manya: "It's not too late to reach the top. How many floors does this tower have?
0x0C04|Torneko: ``As expected, when you're this high up, the scenery on the ground looks artificial, and you don't really feel the height.
0x0C05|Clift: ``Wow! The wind blew and the tower shook! Clift: ``I don't think the pillars supporting the tower would break off...''
0x0C06|Bligh: ``I'll be the first to reach the top, or I'll run out of steam and collapse first...'' Either way, this is the critical moment.
0x0C07|Alina: I've already fought as much as I want, so I'm quite satisfied.
0x0C08|It's a problem because monsters will attack you no matter what you do.
0x0C09|Ryan: ``You've climbed quite a bit, but if you don't have the energy to fight anymore, it would take courage to turn back now.''
0x0C0A|Lucia: ``If you all had wings, you would be able to reach the castle in the sky in a single step...but being human is inconvenient.
0x0C0B|Minea: ``You'll have to go through a lot of trouble to climb up this tower.'' Minea: ``If you're not ready yet, it would be a good idea to turn back as soon as possible.
0x0C0C|Manya: “I get tired of thinking about a floor this big going all the way to the top.
0x0C0D|Torneko: ``The tower, which is said to have been built by the dragon god, seems to be hiding a lot of valuable treasures.''
0x0C0E|Clift: Even though it's a tower, it's built like a temple. It's truly a tower made by God!
0x0C0F|Bligh: It's going to be a long battle, so if you use a lot of spells, your magic will run out in no time.
0x0C10|Arena: ``...I feel like there's a monster. I'm looking forward to seeing what kind of monster will appear!
0x0C11|Ryan: The tower itself is sacred, but what's inside is truly a nest of monsters. Ryan: Does that mean that no one is allowed to go to the top, even if they are qualified?
0x0C12|Lucia: We're finally halfway there. If we climb the other half, we'll be able to reach the castle in the sky.
0x0C13|Minea: Is the presence of monsters in the tower a test for us? Minea: I'm sure the dragon god is testing our strength.
0x0C14|Manya: Have we reached the top yet? I'm getting tired of walking. Patricia: Help me.
0x0C15|Torneko: ``If we expel the monsters from here and put shops on every floor, it'll be really lively.''
0x0C16|Clift: ``I feel calmer because I don't have to feel so stiff on the wall.''
0x0C17|Bly: ``Wow, bururu. It seems like the temperature is getting lower, so it's a bit cold.
0x0C18|Alina: ``My body is getting warm because I've been fighting so many times.
0x0C19|Ryan: “It’s a spacious floor.
0x0C1A|Lucia: It's tiring to walk up the tower in the sky.
0x0C1B|Minea: Is there anyone else who has climbed this tower besides us? Minea: Maybe we will be the first people to climb the tower in the sky.
0x0C1C|Manya: “Can you please stop talking to me? I’m starting to run out of energy to complain…”
0x0C1D|Torneko: If there was an inn here, I might stay there for 10,000 gold a night.
0x0C1E|Clift: ``What? Your face is blue? Clift: It's probably because the air is thin and you're up high, so you don't feel alive. Hahaha...
0x0C1F|Bligh: To get here, I rode on a floor that moved up and down, and carried me to the top.The tower in the sky is the tallest tower I've ever climbed in my life.
0x0C20|Ryan: ``Due to the thin air and fatigue, my attention span has decreased considerably.
0x0C21|{7f43}This is the castle in the sky. Only the chosen ones are allowed to enter... You unqualified person, leave!
0x0C22|A voice can be heard from everywhere...
0x0C23|Minea: "It's a little cold... I'm sure it's because I'm in a high place.
0x0C24|Manya: ``Aaah~... That's a nice sight.'' Manya: ``It's strange that I've liked high places like this ever since I was a child.
0x0C25|Torneko: "If we invite people from above ground to this place, we'll do some good business, but... Torneko: Hmm... That's a bit difficult, isn't it?
0x0C26|Bligh: Pizarro is the king of the demons after all. A place like this probably doesn't suit him.
0x0C27|Clift: If you think about it, I'm just a priest in a castle... Clift: You have to appreciate the miracle of being able to be in a place like this.
0x0C28|Alina: Is there a new threat in the sky? I don't think so.
0x0C29|Ryan: ``Anyway, this is a completely strange place.
0x0C2A|Pissarro: ``Why do you bring me to a place like this?'' Pissarro: ``I tell you, I'm the same person as far as the castle in the sky.
0x0C2B|I won't.
0x0C2C|Minea: "It's a little cold... I'm sure it's because I'm in a high place.
0x0C2D|Manya: ``Aaah~... That's a nice sight.'' Manya: ``It's strange that I've liked high places like this ever since I was a child.
0x0C2E|Torneko: "If we invite people from above ground to this place, we'll do some good business, but... Torneko: Hmm... That's a bit difficult, isn't it?
0x0C2F|Bligh: Huh? Are you heading to Despisaro from Castle in the Sky? Bligh: Is there any other way?
0x0C30|Clift: If you think about it, I'm just a priest in a castle... Clift: You have to appreciate the miracle of being able to be in a place like this.
0x0C31|Alina: If I kick this cloudy ground as hard as I can, will there still be a hole?
0x0C32|Ryan: ``Anyway, this is a completely strange place.
0x0C33|{7f30} “Ggo, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
0x0C34|Minea: On this journey, we may have walked through our entire world.
0x0C35|Manya: Master Dogon is stingy. Even though he was good to the <HERO>, he didn't give us anything. Manya: Since you came all the way, don't you think it would be nice if he gave you some casino coins as a reward for your hard work?
0x0C36|Torneko

0x0C38|It's not too late to do this even after making preparations on the ground.
0x0C39|Clift
0x0C3A|The entrance to this world is a hole in the clouds of Castle in the Sky. Clift: ``I have to jump into that hole.''
0x0C3B|to the world of
0x0C3C|I can't believe it... Ugh, I don't want to think about it.
0x0C3D|Bligh: Thanks to the dragon god's magic, it seems like we too can walk on clouds.
0x0C3E|Arena “Da no kete”
0x0C3F|Uru? I'm so crazy that there's no Clift in the clouds!
0x0C40|Ryan: ``A castle where the dragon god lives...'' Thanks to traveling with <HERO> Dodo, I get to see a lot of things and learn a lot.
0x0C41|Lucia: ``Wow. I'm back to the castle in the sky! It's all thanks to you all.''
0x0C42|Minea: What kind of king rules that castle above the clouds? I want to see it with my own eyes as soon as possible.
0x0C43|Manya: Clouds are quite soft, unlike the ground. I'd like to take a nap here.
0x0C44|Torneko: “There’s a castle on the clouds! It’s the devil’s companion.”
0x0C45|Nisuhea….
0x0C46|Clift: ``Every time I walk, my feet are stuck in the clouds. Clift: ``If I think about passing through the clouds, I'm so scared, I don't want to walk anymore.''
0x0C47|Bligh: ``It's like heaven. I can't believe I came to heaven alive...''
0x0C48|Alina: “Are we walking on clouds right now?
0x0C49|Ryan: What a place this place is!? As a rugged warrior, I can't seem to hide my secret knowledge and personality. This braai is on par with the sky people.
0x0C4A|Clift: ……. Clift: ……………………. Clift: Wow, I’m crying… I’m scared to look at my feet!
0x0C4B|Arena: "It's so peaceful here, it's boring. It's a place where monsters come out.
0x0C4C|Let's come!
0x0C4D|Torneko: "This view! It's nice. I wish I had brought Popolo with me. He loves high places.
0x0C4E|Manya: ``I don't think girls from the sky are very sexy. They're pretty, though.''
0x0C4F|Minea: Was it that Master Dogon that led us? Minea: No, I don't care who it was. I'm grateful. Minea: I was able to meet you all. That makes me really happy.
0x0C50|Pizarro: ``I am the one who rules over the demons. I cannot enter the castle in the sky.'' Pizarro: ``Let's wait in your carriage.''
0x0C51|Pizarro: Wait!
0x0C52|Oh, that's scary! Just then, an evil wave emanated from the ground below and pierced through the clouds. This big hole was created at that time.
0x0C53|The shaking just now was amazing. I'm sure an earthquake that occurs on the ground will feel like the one before. But that evil wave... It didn't cause any damage to the castle, but it did punch a hole in the clouds.
0x0C54|Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. There's no such thing as passing through the clouds and reaching the ground head-on.
0x0C55|I want to go down to the ground. But you can't go down to the ground without Master Dragon's permission. But about ten years ago, a woman here came down to earth without permission.
0x0C56|It seems that someone extremely evil is about to be born on earth.
0x0C57|fault? I wonder if it's been hundreds of years since someone without wings came to the castle in the sky...
0x0C58|This is the castle where the dragon god is kept.
0x0C59|This is Castle in the Sky.
0x0C5A|Lucia: ``Oh, this is the castle in the sky! Thanks to you, I was able to come back! Lucia: Thank you very much. I have to let everyone know that I returned safely! Lucia: ``See you later...''
0x0C5B|A mysterious power works and Lucia is brought back to life!
0x0C5C|Arena: The best choice for a wingless HERO is to return to earth with us!
0x0C5D|Ryan: After completing our mission, it seems that the Skylings have finally recognized the <HERO> as our own kind.
0x0C5E|Manya: ``Oh, you've missed the view overlooking from this castle.'' Manya: ``The reason we entered the castle in the sky was because we were on a mission to destroy the second Emperor of Hell.
0x0C5F|Alina: ``I might never be able to come again, so I'll make sure to burn this view into my eyes!''
0x0C60|Ryan: ``I, a mighty warrior, am standing here in a mysterious castle floating in the sky.'' Ryan: ``Just thinking about that alone makes me feel warm.''
0x0C61|Torneko: ``I just looked through the hole above the ground, and it was incredibly high.'' Torneko: ``I hope it doesn't fall to the ground and break into pieces.
0x0C62|Arena: Wait, Despisaro! Now, quickly, let's jump out of the hole and go to the world of darkness!
0x0C63|Clift: ``I don't like it...I guess the only way to get to the dark world is to jump into that hole.''
0x0C64|Minea: “Is the attack caused by the waves just now a provocation to lure us into a trap?”
0x0C65|Bligh: Since we have enough time to attack the castle, Despisarro may have successfully achieved the ultimate evolution.
0x0C66|Ryan: ``I see. Don't the people in the sky know what an earthquake is?
0x0C67|Clift: Even if the castle doesn't budge, there's still a hole in the clouds... Clift: If the evil wave were to penetrate the clouds beneath our feet, it would fall head over heels on the ground!
0x0C68|Clift: Wow... Is the evil one actually Despisarro?
0x0C69|Arena: Wait, Despisaro! It seems like we were destined to fight someday ever since the martial arts tournament.
0x0C6A|Manya: Well, no matter what happens on the ground, you might be safe if you stay here. Manya: I don't want to have nowhere to go back to, so let's go quickly and exterminate the evil one.
0x0C6B|Ryan: True peace will never come unless we meet Despisaro, who has obtained the secret of evolution.
0x0C6C|Alina: If I had wings, I could fly all the way here without having to climb that boring tower in the sky.
0x0C6D|Clift: Do sky people have longer lifespans than us?
0x0C6E|Manya: Since humans have come here for the first time in hundreds of years, it would be nice if they could throw us a party.
0x0C6F|Bligh: It's been hundreds of years. Even though we don't live for even 100 years...
0x0C70|Minea: I hope Lucia doesn't get punished for dropping the Sword of the Sky...
0x0C71|Alina: ``My arms are weak, but if Lucia had trained, she could have become as strong as me.'' Alina: ``It would be a waste to stop traveling here.
0x0C72|Clift: ``It's not until they're gone that you realize how good a person is.'' Clift: ``No, Lucia was a good girl even when we were together.''
0x0C73|Manya: ``Lucia is a nice girl, but her sensibilities are a little different from the rest of us.'' Manya: ``Well, it can't be helped since she grew up in a place like this.''
0x0C74|Ryan: ``It's sad to think we're saying goodbye here. I should have spent more time with Lucia.''
0x0C75|Manya: ``I think he'll become a star in no time if he plays the Skyman in Montbarbara.''
0x0C76|Torneko: ``It's pretty spectacular. Everyone who lives here has wings, just like Lucia.''
0x0C77|Bligh: ``It's so hot! It's so hot! The wind is touching my bones.''
0x0C78|Clift: Is this castle okay? I wonder if it will slip through the base of the cloud and fall to the ground...
0x0C79|Alina: ``The air is really thin. I think I can improve my stamina by training my body here!
0x0C7A|Ryan: "Now that I think about it, I've come a long way. I never thought I'd come to the castle in the sky, even though I'm a great warrior.
0x0C7B|Minea: It was because of <HERO>'s guidance that someone like me was able to enter the castle in the sky.
0x0C7C|Our Master Dragon says that the underground barrier set up by Despisarro has disappeared. However, it seems that someone is still trying to use the secret method of evolution to achieve evil evolution. Hero <HERO>... please destroy that person's ambitions along with the secret of evolution.
0x0C7D|{7f30} stepped outside and got into the carriage!
0x0C7E|Lucia: I look forward to your success!
0x0C7F|Lucia: Please take this child with you. I'm sure he will be of help.
0x0C80|Lucia: {7f30}! Come here.
0x0C81|Lucia: Oh, what about you!? Thanks to you, I can take care of these children again. Lucia: That's right. I have to do something to thank you...
0x0C82|You guys are going to go to a difficult place from now on. By the way, have you gotten the Baron's horn yet? If you haven't already... Rumor has it that it sleeps in the eastern shrine of Gotside Town.
0x0C83|It is said that Despisaro used a secret method to create a barrier underground to prevent anyone from interfering with his evolution. In order to stop Despisarro from evolving, we must first break that barrier. May God bless the hero <HERO>.
0x0C84|Guorn Guorn.
0x0C85|Gurululu.
0x0C86|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x0C87|Manya: Well, the final battle might have been a little dangerous without me.
0x0C88|Alina: ``I really wanted to show you our deadly battle with the Emperor of Hell!''
0x0C89|Ryan: ``I think the reason we were able to return home alive from the final battle was because we all worked together.
0x0C8A|Manya: Lucia has started saying stubborn things like, ``I'm proud of you.''
0x0C8B|Ryan: Now that we've completed our mission, I feel like I won't be able to see Lucia like I used to.
0x0C8C|Alina: ``I'll give Despisaro a handicap. At most, I hope he evolves in the depths of the earth!''
0x0C8D|Torneko: "Hey, Despisaro is trying to evolve! This is a big deal. Torneko: "If we wait too long, we'll have to fight something like Estark again.
0x0C8E|Manya: In the first place, my father was killed just after creating the secret method of evolution. Manya: In that case, unless we destroy the secret method of evolution, we can't say the slaying is over.
0x0C8F|Minea: The secret of evolution created by my father is now in Despisaro's hands and he is abusing it.
0x0C90|Ryan: Let's use the secret of evolution to make Despisaro a dead man.
0x0C91|Minea: Lucia looks ladylike for some reason when she's with the Skyling. Is she wearing a cat hat?
0x0C92|Clift: ``She was conspicuous during her journey, but when the only Skylings around her are Lucia-san, she seems normal.''
0x0C93|Ryan: ``As expected, Lucia doesn't talk to me as casually as before with the other Skylings.
0x0C94|Manya: Well, Lucia has become quite aloof since she came here.
0x0C95|Arena: Since it's a dragon, {7f30}'s scales must be hard and tough. Arena: If that's the case, you might not need to wear any armor.
0x0C96|Minea: ``I'm not one of those people who are currently running around, but I'm sure they are a valuable force.
0x0C97|Bligh: ``Well, Dragon. Now that I've come here, I've made another strong friend.
0x0C98|Manya: {7f30}Oh... Maybe if we let him dance on the Montbarbara stage, he might become popular.

0x0CE2|History of battle.... Cohon.... A long time ago, the king of the demons, Estark, created something terrifying. That is the secret of evolution. Estarc used that power to evolve himself into the ultimate creature that surpasses even God. However, after learning of the situation, Skyman fought Estark together with Master Dragon. After a long battle, Estark was finally sealed away in the depths of the earth. Even Master Dragon could only contain Estark, but not annihilate it. Don't wake Estarch. Don't approach him. ...It is written. However, I later learned that Estark's secret of evolution was still incomplete. At that time, the golden bracelet that amplified the power of darkness had not yet been used.
0x0CE3|is that so. See you someday...
0x0CE4|Would you like to read the book here?
0x0CE5|About the secret of evolution. Cohon.... The secret method of evolution is a secret method that distorts the original path of evolution. If you use this secret method, you will be able to create creatures that should not exist in this world. The secret of evolution is the source of all disasters. Do not pass on the secrets of evolution to future generations. Contain it deep underground... ...It is written. However, after many years, it was discovered again. It may have been caused by the grudges of creatures that were thrown off the path of evolution.
0x0CE6|is that so. See you someday...
0x0CE7|Would you like to read the book here?
0x0CE8|There may be some books here that you won't be able to read. It would be a good idea to have the two people there read it.
0x0CE9|Reese: “Hmm.
0x0CEA|Reese: “Yes, sister.
0x0CEB|Well, you guys are humans. Reese, don't talk!
0x0CEC|Kururin Kururin.
0x0CED|The book is full of characters I've never seen before.
0x0CEE|There was an old dragon training diary. {7f4b} was also written in legible characters. Today is Doran's birthday. We were born in the same year, so both Lucia and Doran are eight years old today. But Doran is already an adult. It seems that sky-people and dragons grow up at different speeds.
0x0CEF|There was a diary of Tenkujin. {7f4b} was also written in legible characters. No matter how much time passes, Master Dragon will never forgive her for breaking the law and going down to earth. At any moment, Master Dragon will steal her happiness in the most cruel way possible. I will do whatever it takes to bring her back to the earth before the tragedy occurred. So no matter how much you hate me...
0x0CF0|Manya: “Hey, not only <HERO> but also my name will be added to history, right?
0x0CF1|Alina: “We accomplished something amazing that will go down in history!
0x0CF2|Ryan: ``The name of <HERO> will be passed down here for a long time.
0x0CF3|Manya: That sounds like crap! I wonder why they always say "elf" in such a twisted way.
0x0CF4|Alina: “It looks like the elves finally understand that there are good people too!
0x0CF5|Ryan: ``Hahahaha <HERO>Everyone seems embarrassed to be called a hero to my face.
0x0CF6|Alina: I see, <HERO> chose not to remain here and instead returned to the surface with us.
0x0CF7|Ryan: ``Even though I'm going back to Earth, which <HERO>'s hometown is already...'' Ryan: ``If you don't mind, would you like to come with me to Butland? Well, think about it.
0x0CF8|Manya: I feel like I've finally become free. Manya: Maybe it's because I've finally been freed from my big destiny.
0x0CF9|Alina: I wonder if everyone in Santheim has returned to the castle safely.
0x0CFA|Ryan: Now that the secret of evolution is gone, people will never be threatened by the Emperor of Hell again.
0x0CFB|Manya: If the secret of evolution were to disappear, there would be no more idiots who would try to evolve into the ultimate creature.
0x0CFC|I'm glad that I got the item back, but I'm even more happy that I was able to settle things with Despisaro!
0x0CFD|Ryan: “Now that I think about it, Despisaro was also a poor guy.
0x0CFE|Bligh: I guess it was the people living in the world of darkness who took away the people of Santheim.
0x0CFF|Minea: The sword in the sky, blessed by Master Dragon, will protect us from darkness.
0x0D00|Clift: Are you referring to the black light that shook the castle earlier?
0x0D01|Manya: I'm a little worried that I won't be able to defeat a monster that attacks the castle in the sky from the depths of the earth...
0x0D02|Ryan: There may be a formidable trap set in the dark world that awaits us.
0x0D03|Minea: The reborn Sword of the Sky will definitely bring victory to our battle.
0x0D04|Manya: ``The mere fact that there was a castle floating in the sky was surprising, but I didn't know that there was also a god...''
0x0D05|Torneko: The purpose of my trip was to find the sword in the sky, but before I knew it, I ended up fighting a monster...oh my.
0x0D06|Bligh: Master Dragon, the God of Dragons. Bligh: To be able to meet something as special as this while I'm still alive makes me wish I had lived a long time.
0x0D07|Clift: I wonder if we, mere humans, can defeat the ultimate evolved creature...
0x0D08|Alina: “This time, we can finally settle the matter with Despisaro without anyone interfering with us!
0x0D09|Ryan: Let's hurry. Let's go and crush Despisarro's ambitions!
0x0D0A|Minea: "Hero-san was left on the ground for a long time because he had half human blood mixed in with him. Minea: When you think about it, Master Dragon is also terrible.
0x0D0B|Manya: "That's amazing <HERO>. That soldier just called you a hero!
0x0D0C|Ryan: <HERO>I guess the reason Skyling doesn't have wings is because half of it has human blood mixed in with it.
0x0D0D|Clift: If Estark woke up and came to the surface, things would have been pretty bad by now.
0x0D0E|Alina: ``Was the reason we won against Estark because Estark's evolution was incomplete? Alina: ``That's not fun. I want to fight the complete version of Estark!''
0x0D0F|Ryan: ``We were able to defeat Estark, but now Despisaro is about to become the second Estarc.
0x0D10|Torneko: ``The secret of evolution is scary. If burying it doesn't work, I guess there's no other choice but to knock it down.''
0x0D11|Bligh: Apparently, the secret of evolution is something that can be revived over and over again over many years, no matter how many times it is sealed away.
0x0D12|Manya: I'd like to do a little experiment with the Secret of Evolution. Manya: If you use the Secret of Evolution on a perverse person, will they become honest, or if you use it on a lazy person, will they evolve into a hard worker?
0x0D13|Minea: If my father hadn't been an alchemist, I wouldn't have learned the secret of evolution and I wouldn't have lost my life.
0x0D14|Alina: "Do elves hate humans? Come to think of it, the elves in the Twitter Tower also ran away when they saw me.
0x0D15|Toruneko: ``When I'm told not to criticize, I feel like forcing myself to do so.'' Toruneko: ``If Mr. Panon was here, I could at least make him laugh.''
0x0D16|Minea: ``It's a cute elf. It's like my older sister when I was a child.''
0x0D17|Manya: ``You're such a cheeky elf. I think I'll punish you.''
0x0D18|There is an old book that says ``In Search of the Magic Wand, Chapter 4.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. I am the wizard Madrue. Although I didn't feel like it, I decided to take this as part of my job and crawl into the cave. It is said that in order to find the magic wand, you should look at the bottom of the deepest treasure chest... The innermost room must have been very carefully designed. Do you hate me that much? Muki~! ! ...No, I was a little distraught. Anyway, once I find this magic wand, I'll stop doing this kind of work. I'm going to go back to my hometown and start some kind of business with the money I've been working hard to save. From now on, I'll live my life as I please!
0x0D19|Torneko: "Hmm... I see, this is a material I've never seen before. This key is a valuable item. Torneko: Oops. Just because of that doesn't mean you can't sell it.
0x0D1A|Clift: If we have this key, a new path may be born for us.
0x0D1B|Minea: “Thank you. Dad….
0x0D1C|Manya: “Yes, there is! My father is really good at teasing me.”
0x0D1D|Manya: ``I can't believe that my father had a room like this without even letting us know...'' Manya: ``I can't believe he was doing other things besides research.'' It's about your father.
0x0D1E|Minea: “I didn’t know. The room that my father used….
0x0D1F|Orin: ``Anyway, I'll take you with me! Now, let's hurry!''
0x0D20|Orin: Oh! That's it! You already have it!
0x0D21|Yay! To Manya-sama Minea-sama! It's me! This is my disciple Orin! Orin: "What!? A journey to defeat Kataki, just the two of us? Oh... what can I say! Orin: "Then, I too have the same wish as you, Master Edgan! Orin: I was waiting here for Lord Edgan to recover from his wounds, with only the thought of defeating Kataki in my heart! Orin: Rumor has it that Balzac sold his soul to the devil and acquired a powerful power. Orin: But... If only I had the Orb of Silence, I should be able to seal away his power!
0x0D22|I found a button at the bottom of the treasure chest! Would you like to press it?
0x0D23|Manya: ``Huh? My father is really good at hiding things.''
0x0D24|Minea: “I can’t believe there’s such a trick in this treasure box…”
0x0D25|Manya: “Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa… I feel sorry for you for just staying there.
0x0D26|Minea: There must be a reason why Mr. Orin was in this depths. Minea: There's still something in this cave. There's no doubt about it.
0x0D27|Arena: ``Okay! No matter what kind of monster appears, this arena will deal with it!
0x0D28|Lucia: ``I'm always up in the sky, so being under the ground is quite exciting and wonderful.
0x0D29|Bligh: ``There's a sign of a monster. In any case, don't let your guard down.
0x0D2A|Manya: ``There's no use for this cave anymore, right? In that case, let's get out of there quickly!''
0x0D2B|Manya: Hey, can't we get out of here yet? Manya: Huh? Orb of Silence? It doesn't matter.
0x0D2C|Orin: ``Minea-sama and Manya-sama are suffering even more than I can be...'' Orin: ``From now on, no matter what happens, I won't cause you any hardships.
0x0D2D|Minea: If Orin-san is here, fighting monsters will be a lot easier.
0x0D2E|Manya: ``I'm glad that Orin is alive.'' Manya: ``Now, the target we're aiming for is Balzac. Let's get out of here quickly.''
0x0D2F|Minea: I can't believe there are people in a place like this...
0x0D30|Manya: "It's dark. It's cold. It's humid. It's really bad. My back is itchy!
0x0D31|Manya: ``Ah... I feel sorry for myself for being in this cave again...''
0x0D32|Minea: There must be a reason why Mr. Orin was in this depths. Minea: There's still something in this cave. There's no doubt about it.
0x0D33|Arena: ``Okay! No matter what kind of monster appears, this arena will deal with it!
0x0D34|Lucia: ``I'm always up in the sky, so being under the ground is quite exciting and wonderful.
0x0D35|Bligh: ``There's a sign of a monster. In any case, we mustn't let our guard down. Bligh, bligh, bry, bry, bry!
0x0D36|There's no use for it, right? If so, let's get out right away!
0x0D37|Manya: Hey, can't we get out of here yet? Manya: Huh? Orb of Silence? It doesn't matter.
0x0D38|Minea: I can't believe there are people in a place like this...

0x0D68|Huh?
0x0D69|! Arena is so hard Manya... It's so hot. A cave is a place where you can listen unconditionally.
0x0D6A|Oh? Did you guys come to this cave to find the Orb of Silence? But it's better to give up. I also came all the way from Montbarbara... I just can't find the stairs to go down.
0x0D6B|I heard that there is an alchemist's secret laboratory here... I just can't find the stairs to go down. Even though I know that there is a mechanism at the bottom of the treasure chest that will open the entrance... Hohoho.
0x0D6C|Manya: ``Ah... I feel sorry for myself for being in this cave again...''
0x0D6D|Minea: There must be a reason why Mr. Orin was in this depths. Minea: There's still something in this cave. There's no doubt about it.
0x0D6E|Manya: The reason I can't find the stairs to go down is because that old man lacks wisdom and courage. Manya: I think I said the same thing before. Is it just my imagination?
0x0D6F|Arena: ``Okay! No matter what kind of monster appears, this arena will deal with it!
0x0D70|Lucia: ``I'm always up in the sky, so being under the ground is quite exciting and wonderful.

0x0D73|Manya: Hey, can't we get out of here yet? Manya: Huh? Orb of Silence? It doesn't matter.
0x0D74|Orin: ``That floor that moves up and down is a contraption made by Lord Edgan.It won't be easy to find it.''
0x0D75|Manya: The reason you can't find the stairs to go down is because that old man lacks wisdom and courage.
0x0D76|Minea: I can't believe there are people in a place like this...
0x0D77|Manya: “Oh, no, no. I absolutely hate places like caves.
0x0D78|Grrrr...
0x0D79|Oh, I'm sure it's Mr. Orin. You were alive. That's good.
0x0D7A|It was really difficult. I can't believe that a nice person like Mr. Edgan would be so taken aback by one of his disciples. Come to think of it, Edgan-san had another disciple. Did you go to Orin? Orin was also seriously injured. Where are you doing?...
0x0D7B|This is just a rumor, but it seems that Edgan was unable to make any money in the end. But instead, he made an amazing discovery. You said it was the secret of evolution.
0x0D7C|Pesta: “Kun kun.
0x0D7D|Ever since King Leo took over, tax collection has become stricter. I have to work until this late night. The previous king, who died, would not have allowed something like this to happen. Grumbling...
0x0D7E|I absolutely hate Balzac! I guess he became Edgan's disciple from the beginning with the intention of stealing his inventions.
0x0D7F|I absolutely hate Balzac! I guess he became Edgan's disciple from the beginning with the intention of stealing his inventions. By the way, this is a secret... It seems that Edgan's other disciple, Orin, is hiding in a cave to the west of this village. Orin might know what's good about Balzac...
0x0D80|Pesta: “Wan, wan, wan!
0x0D81|Oh Minea! What a figure... That's why I told you so much to stop attacking Kataki...
0x0D82|Hey, it's not Minea-chan! You're back. After all, your hometown is nice, right?
0x0D83|Heheen!
0x0D84|Heheen!
0x0D85|How long has it been since Edgan passed away? Back then, the puppy that Minea picked up grew up in my place. He's a smart dog, so I'm sure he remembers us both.
0x0D86|Nmooooo.
0x0D87|This is Komiz village. Oh, I'm sure you're Edgan-san's daughter! That's right, you're back!
0x0D88|It is engraved with the words ``Alchemist Edgan Rests Here''.
0x0D89|Alchemist Edgan's house.
0x0D8A|Manya: How long are you going to stay in a place like this? Leave this country as soon as possible.
0x0D8B|Manya: ``The secret of evolution...'' Manya: ``...What? I felt really bad about it...I'm sorry, Pesta. After I defeat my father, Kataki, then we can live together again.
0x0D8C|Orin: I had decided to return here after defeating my master Edgan-sama's Kataki...
0x0D8D|Manya: Hmm... No matter when I come, it's a village that lacks interest.
0x0D8E|Minea: ``My father is no longer here, but just being here makes me feel relieved.''
0x0D8F|Orin: "Damn Balzac... Lord Edgan, who paid so much attention to me... Damn it!
0x0D90|Manya: Speaking of the West Cave, my father used to go there too. Manya: I wonder if there's something in that place.
0x0D91|Minea: That's right... Come to think of it, I wonder what Orin-san has been up to since then? Minea: If Orin-san was here, I'm sure he would be our strength...
0x0D92|Minea: Pesta, you remember us well!
0x0D93|Minea: “Ahaha. I see Pesta is doing well too!
0x0D94|Manya: ``Calvin the cow still seems to be doing well.'' Manya: ``Since I was a child, I've decided that I'm definitely going to eat that guy someday.''
0x0D95|Minea: “Hehe. I’m glad that everyone hasn’t changed.
0x0D96|Orin: I had decided to return here after defeating my master Edgan-sama's Kataki...
0x0D97|Manya: Hmm... No matter when I come, it's a village that lacks interest.
0x0D98|Minea: ``My father is gone, but just being here makes me feel relieved.''
0x0D99|Minea: ``......'' Minea: ``It's like time has stopped here, just like that day...''
0x0D9A|Minea: ``......'' Minea: ``It's like time has stopped here, just like that day...''
0x0D9B|Please don't bully me. I'm not a bad slime. Ah, that's right! A man named Orin could even break open a locked door!
0x0D9C|Manya: ``During my long absence, something strange has moved in again.
0x0D9D|Manya: Minea, hurry up. You'll only feel sad if you stay here.
0x0D9E|Minea: Sister... Do you still remember that day? Minea: I guess... I'll never forget it.

0x0E3D|Castle. Even though I thought he was being chaotic and lacking in intelligence, he was still an idiot after all.
0x0E3E|No reply. It looks like it's just a piece of paper...
0x0E3F|Orin: It looks like... it doesn't look like I'll be able to go with you anymore... Orin: I'm sorry, but... For now, there will definitely be a day when this country will be decided... Orin: Until the day I fulfill my father's mission, please both of us, please be safe... Ugh!
0x0E40|Orin: Leave this to me and run away! Come on, hurry!
0x0E41|It's... Jailbreak! Someone please lend me a hand!
0x0E42|Orin: "Damn! You found it! It's so dark... Wow!
0x0E43|Mmmmm! ? Where did you guys come from?
0x0E44|Grrrr... Hakushon! Grrrr...
0x0E45|Ah, I'll catch it! Wow!
0x0E46|Dehehe. I won't let you escape. Dehehe.
0x0E47|The minister of this castle is a very nervous person. The man who surprised the minister by making a loud noise the other day was put in a prison in a port town. Is it a port town? It should be on the beach a little north of this castle.
0x0E48|Hmm, that's strange.... I feel like I can hear people's voices coming from beneath my feet.
0x0E49|Even though the minister of this castle is timid, he is always shouting. Try making a loud noise in front of his room. I'm sure he'll be surprised and go tell the king. Kyahaha!
0x0E4A|I think only the minister knows where the king's room is. If you follow the minister, you'll understand, but what happens next is scary.
0x0E4B|This is the great castle King Leo!
0x0E4C|Somehow I found something.
0x0E4D|Minea: Mr. Orin...
0x0E4E|Manya: Hey, Minea. No matter what happens, no matter what we do, we'll definitely survive. Manya: If we die, no one will be able to defeat Father and Orin's Kataki...
0x0E4F|Minea: Mr. Orin...
0x0E50|Manya: “Okay, let’s go!
0x0E51|Minea: Because Mr. Orin...
0x0E52|Manya: Run away, Minea!
0x0E53|Minea: A strange castle...
0x0E54|Manya: ``Wow. That guy might be seriously broken.
0x0E55|Minea: A strange castle...
0x0E56|Orin: If you want to go beyond the locked door, leave it to Orin.
0x0E57|Minea: "It's a rather intimidating castle...
0x0E58|Manya: First of all, we should meet the king here.
0x0E59|Manya: If you go north from here to a port town, it's definitely Habaria. Manya: If you go there, will you find out anything?
0x0E5A|Manya: “What? What are you using to say that I don’t think about anything?”
0x0E5B|Minea: ``I wonder how we can get to the king's room... Sister, please think about it.''
0x0E5C|Manya: ``It's a great castle.'' I thought you were being ignorant and chaotic, but you're still an idiot.
0x0E5D|Orin: If you want to go beyond the locked door, leave it to Orin.
0x0E5E|Minea: "It's a rather intimidating castle...
0x0E5F|Manya: First of all, we should meet the king here.
0x0E60|Minea: ``It's kind of an intimidating castle... I wonder how I can get inside.''

0x0E93|Chairman: ``I see. It's finally time to go. Chairman: ``I don't know where you're going, but it might be a good idea to go back to Komiz Village once in a while.'' Chairman: ``I'm sure your father will be happy if you visit the graves. Be careful as you go.''
0x0E94|Chairman: ``I'd like you to stay a little longer since you're popular, but I'm not going to stop you from attacking Kataki.'' Chairman: ``You should take a good rest today and leave tomorrow morning. Be careful when you go.''
0x0E95|Manya and the others obtained 100G.
0x0E96|Chairperson: ``Well, don't be too disappointed. If you don't rush, just keep on traveling, you'll definitely find it someday. Chairperson: ``That's right, this is what we've been up to today. It's been a lot of work.
0x0E97|Minea: “Yes….
0x0E98|Manya: Oh, that's right. Unfortunately, Balzac wasn't there either.
0x0E99|Minea: “No! It’s different! It’s Balzac. Kataki’s Balzac!
0x0E9A|Manya: No, no. There weren't many nice guys today either.
0x0E9B|Minea: “Thank you for your hard work, sister. How was it? Were you there?
0x0E9C|Manya: ``Oh, we've got another new girl joining us.'' Manya: ``But it might be a little difficult for that girl to catch up with this Manya-chan's popularity. Huh.
0x0E9D|Manya: If I ever get stuck in life, I'll be indebted to you again.
0x0E9E|Minea: Yes, the chairman is right. There's no need for us in this town right now.
0x0E9F|Manya: ``If you're stuck in life, Mr. Chairman, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now, right now. Let's just say, ``I'm sad.''''
0x0EA0|Minea: Yes, the chairman is right. There is no need for us in this town right now. Minea: Sister. Let's go back to Komiz Village.
0x0EA1|Come on, come on! Enjoy a fun night of singing and dancing to your heart's content!
0x0EA2|The stage is just down the stairs.
0x0EA3|The stage is just down the stairs. Hey Manya! I heard you left town, but I guess you're back. Yeah yeah.
0x0EA4|This is a theater. If you're the chairperson, you'll be in the basement waiting room.
0x0EA5|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x0EA6|There is a book called ``Odoriko Fan Book.'' I picked up {7f4b}. It looks like a book that introduces popular dancers of all time. Next issue's special feature: Everything about super idol Manya! An article is planned...
0x0EA7|picture? Where is the poet here? I think he would have gone to the theater to get a job.
0x0EA8|Ah, sleepy, sleepy... If you have something to say, I'll listen to it again tonight. Mummy...
0x0EA9|Damn it, Linda ran away! If you find it, I won't leave it for free!
0x0EAA|alchemy? Oh I know. It's about turning iron into gold, right? Many people are conducting research, but I don't think any of them have succeeded in doing so.
0x0EAB|I'm waiting here for the dancer to pass by. I can't help but feel the chaos of the dancers who are tired of dancing after work.
0x0EAC|Damn it, Linda, where did you run away to? ? I heard that you received a call from King Leo's castle!
0x0EAD|It seems that Linda, who worked at the bar, has disappeared. I was a big seller.
0x0EAE|The bar opens at night. Sorry.
0x0EAF|This is Montbarbara, the city of song and dance. If you go north, you will find Komiz village.
0x0EB0|Mr. Edgan, an alchemist from Cormis Village, was killed by his disciple Balzac. Oh my god! ? Were you Edgan-san's daughters? ? I feel sorry for her... Ugh.
0x0EB1|Singing and dancing are fine, but I'd like to see a traveling entertainer who can make me laugh from the bottom of my heart.
0x0EB2|I'm waiting here for the dancer to pass by. As the dancer heads to work, I can't help but feel the urge to do it.
0x0EB3|Manya: How long are you going to stay in a place like this? Leave this country as soon as possible.
0x0EB4|Minea: "This person... wasn't he here during the day? I wonder if he's here all day...
0x0EB5|Manya: It's so arrogant of poor people to let us see the dancers without paying! It's the worst!
0x0EB6|Orin: I heard that Manya-sama was working as a dancer in this town!? Orin: I really wanted to see that at least once... You must have gone through a lot of trouble.
0x0EB7|Manya: ``It feels like the smell of lewd men is wafting through the town. Oh no, no.
0x0EB8|Minea: ``The loud voices of people are coming from every building.
0x0EB9|Manya: Come to think of it, I was curious about what Linda said. Manya: I wonder what King Leo's new king's terrifying experiments are all about.
0x0EBA|Manya: ``I totally understand how you feel, Linda.'' Manya: ``When I see the faces of these lewd men day after day, I want to run away. Yeah, yeah.''
0x0EBB|Minea: ``...Sister. Stop complaining and let's go quickly.''
0x0EBC|Manya: Hey, Minea. I've been thinking about a business idea for a while... Manya: Don't you think if there was a bar where you could drink during the day, you'd get a lot of customers?
0x0EBD|Minea: I guess it's well known in this town that my father was killed... Minea: Balzac... I thought of my father's students like family.
0x0EBE|Manya: To be frank, someone else's sympathy doesn't amount to even one gold.
0x0EBF|Manya: It's so arrogant of poor people to let us see the dancers without paying! It's the worst!
0x0EC0|Orin: I heard that Manya-sama was working as a dancer in this town!? Orin: I really wanted to see that at least once... There were so many Lili, Lilili, Ohlinli.
0x0EC1|Manya: At night, men with lewd faces come all the time, so it's best to act while it's still daylight.
0x0EC2|Minea: A town of song and dance... That's right, this town sleeps during the day.
0x0EC3|Ah, I didn't get the job after all. By the way... I heard that King Leo's castle calls over the women and sings songs almost every day. But for some reason, none of the girls who went to that castle came back.
0x0EC4|Hey, you guys were on a trip looking for your father's Kataki! ? It will be difficult, but no matter what, don't give up halfway through.
0x0EC5|It was only for a short time, but it was fun working together. Good luck fighting Kataki.
0x0EC6|Minea: Good morning, sister. Now, let's go out.
0x0EC7|Manya: I've also heard bad rumors about King Leo. Manya: There were rumors that the lewd king was probably keeping girls around him.
0x0EC8|Minea: I wonder what's going on in King Leo's castle...
0x0EC9|Manya: ``Ah, I feel like it's a little bit sad to say goodbye to everyone.''
0x0ECA|Manya: ``Wow...... Last night's last dance was a little too intense. My hips...
0x0ECB|Minea: ``You woke up easily, which is unusual for an older sister.I hope it doesn't rain.''
0x0ECC|Welcome. Let's drink, sing, and forget all the bad things!
0x0ECD|alchemy
0x0ECE|Why is Edgan the younger brother?
0x0ECF|Perhaps he was killed by Balzac...
0x0ED0|Yo! You guys were Edgun-san's daughters. By the way, did Mr. Edgan succeed in turning iron into gold? Huh? Don't you know? But if you can do that, you can even become king. Wow...
0x0ED1|Drinking after work is great. Kaa, it’s delicious!
0x0ED2|It is decorated with a painting depicting a sunset over Montbarbara.
0x0ED3|Minea: Dad... I must have felt so disappointed that my dream of alchemy couldn't come true.
0x0ED4|This room was Linda's room, but I wonder where she went...
0x0ED5|picture? Is this Pafupafu's room? Hehehe, it's not there.
0x0ED6|No way! This isn't the place for people like you.
0x0ED7|It is decorated with beautifully drawn landscape paintings.
0x0ED8|Manya: “What on earth are you imagining?
0x0ED9|Minea: “No, no! I can’t believe you came to a place like this. Your sister is so disheveled!
0x0EDA|Linda: Please! Please don't miss it! I don't want to go to the castle! Linda: Because I heard that there was a revolution in King Leo's castle, and the king was killed. Linda: And that the new king was conducting horrible experiments called alchemy...
0x0EDB|Grrrr... God, please give me the strength to protect the poor lamb. Grrrr...
0x0EDC|I don't know who you're looking for, but I'm the only one in this room. Go away!
0x0EDD|It is decorated with beautifully drawn landscape paintings.
0x0EDE|Manya: I've also heard bad rumors about King Leo. Manya: There were rumors that the lewd king was probably keeping girls around him.
0x0EDF|Minea: It seems like something is happening in King Leo's castle...
0x0EE0|Minea: Sister, let's go. This isn't our place.
0x0EE1|Manya: “What? You’re a nuisance, old man! You can’t go over there!
0x0EE2|Mummy... There must be a secret in that cave. Grrrr...
0x0EE3|I went looking for her and when I came back, she was asleep! I wonder where he was going...

0x0EEC|Orin: "Master Edgan... Olin's life will definitely depend on Orin.
0x0EED|Minea: Our next goal is King Leo's castle.
0x0EEE|Manya: Don't stay here forever, aim for King Leo's castle.
0x0EEF|Orin: Balzac's guy. Where on earth is he hiding...?
0x0EF0|Orin: ``It's been a long time since I've been out like this, Orin...'' Orin: ``I've been waiting in that cave for a long time to recover from my injuries...''
0x0EF1|Manya: Well, the story that caught my attention so far is... Manya: After all, it's about King Leo. What should we do? Should we go to King Leo's castle?
0x0EF2|Minea: I understand that Balzac sold his soul to the devil after killing his father, but... Minea: We still don't know where he really is.
0x0EF3|Manya: In any case, our journey isn't over until we defeat Balzac.
0x0EF4|Minea: “My father, Kataki... Where on earth is Balzac?”
0x0EF5|People's various...
0x0EF6|The ship is leaving. Daughter. I don't know what happened in this country, but please take care of yourself. Just stay alive
0x0EF7|I'm sure something good will happen...

0x0F04|In that case, come back after finishing your business. I'll wait for you for a while.
0x0F05|Good luck! Let's set sail! Everyone, take your place! Raise the anchor!
0x0F06|Once the ship leaves, there will be no way to return to this country. Don't you have any memories? Is it okay if I take the boat out?
0x0F07|I'm the captain of this ship. We'll be leaving soon, so please go to the cabin below.
0x0F08|This ship's destination is Endor. What kind of country is it? It's exciting.
0x0F09|The cabin is downstairs. Customer!
0x0F0A|I brought my boarding ticket. Come on, let's ride! We'll be setting sail soon!
0x0F0B|Do you have a boarding ticket? If you don't have it, there's no way you can ride it. Come on out again!
0x0F0C|Manya: If you ride this, you can go to Endor.
0x0F0D|Minea: “The ship was that big...
0x0F0E|A friend of mine named Torneko has opened a shop in Endor, and I'm going there to celebrate.
0x0F0F|Apparently, there was someone who tried to kill King Leo. I don't know who they are, but they're going to do some terrible things.

0x0F12|Ahhh, I'm busy! Everyone drinks so much that it's hard to take orders!
0x0F13|Apparently, a princess from a castle somewhere won the martial arts tournament held in Endor. But when the princess returned to her castle after the match, she found it completely empty. There are some strange things.
0x0F14|King Leo used to be a peaceful country, but the previous king suddenly passed away. The next son did not become king himself and appointed a man to whom he was not related by blood as the new king. Since then, this country has been in ruins. Huh? Is it the name of the new king? I'm sure Bal... it was somehow fine.
0x0F15|It's fun. Ah, that!
0x0F16|Jill: “I’m Jill. Come on, you too, dance, dance!”
0x0F17|Hey! Have you had any alcohol yet? Alcohol!

0x0F1B|Manya: The princess in the castle won the martial arts tournament? Manya: If there is such a strong princess, I would definitely like to meet her.
0x0F1C|Minea: “King Leo’s new king’s name is Bal!? I wonder what that means...”
0x0F1D|Manya: ``You must be naive to invite this Manya-chan to dance. Manya: If I really danced, men's eyes would be glued to me.''
0x0F1E|Manya: “The bars are the same in every town.

0x0F56|Apparently, if you use the Orb of Silence, you can seal away the enemy's magic.
0x0F57|Please listen! I haven't done anything bad. However, I made a slight mistake and detonated gunpowder near the minister's room in the castle... Is it gunpowder? I was in the Atemt mine in the west a long time ago, so I got this at that time.
0x0F58|This is a prison. There are people who rebelled against King Leo.
0x0F59|Manya: ``I wonder why he's in prison for so long.''
0x0F5A|Manya: ``I agree with surprising the minister in the same way.It seems fun.''
0x0F5B|Minea: Atemt of the West... I wonder if there's a hint to grasping something there...
0x0F5C|Orin: From what I've seen, Balzac doesn't seem to be here.
0x0F5D|Manya: Hey Minea. Isn't it kind of creepy here? It's definitely a prison.
0x0F5E|Manya: ``I wonder why he's in prison for so long.''
0x0F5F|Manya: ``I agree with surprising the minister in the same way.It seems fun.''
0x0F60|Minea: Atemt of the West... I wonder if there's a hint to grasping something there...
0x0F61|Orin: From what I've seen, Balzac doesn't seem to be here.
0x0F62|Manya: Hey Minea. Isn't it kind of creepy here? It's definitely a prison.
0x0F63|There is a book called ``The complete collection of lyrics of the mine man's songs.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. We'll dig ♪ We'll dig as far as we can ♪ Dig, dig, dig, dig through ♪ ...But I couldn't sing it to {7f4b} because I didn't understand the melody.
0x0F64|There is a book called ``A life that lives in this world.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. In this world, not only us humans, but also many other forms of life live together. Although there are some species that cannot understand each other, there are also many species that should be able to get along with each other. If you see a hobbit or an elf somewhere, never bully them.
0x0F65|Grrrr...
0x0F66|Pippin: "Grrr... Papa! It's me. It's Pippin. Mummy...
0x0F67|My name is Luna. Our father worked in the mines of this country. Luna: ``My brother and I came to see our father, but he was already dead...'' Luna: ``Oh, what should I say to my brother Pippin? Ugh...''
0x0F68|Oh my, I found my favorite girl! I'll definitely give it to my girlfriend and take it home! Where is it? car! Don't ask! It's embarrassing! This is Jill from the bar. Hey!
0x0F69|It is decorated with beautifully drawn landscape paintings.
0x0F6A|Minea: ``We're not the only ones who are having hard times...It's only natural.
0x0F6B|The man you are targeting is protected by a huge power of darkness. But there's nothing to worry about. I can see it. You too are protected by the shining power... It may be a small, thin light now, but it will lead to many lights and eventually become a great power. Don't rush. That's when you find yourself lost in the path of despair... That's when your journey begins.
0x0F6C|Minea, the fortune teller. You can already see it.
0x0F6D|This is a place to tell. A sacred shrine where God's message descends.
0x0F6E|Minea: ``Slim, small lights... guided me over and over again... Minea: Yes, I noticed it a long time ago. Currently, we don't have Balzac... Minea: ``...Uh... It's nothing. Don't worry about it, sister.
0x0F6F|Manya: What? What? What can you see? Minea: Can you see something?
0x0F70|Minea: This place is somehow strange. Seven small flames surrounding a large flame...
0x0F71|Goho goho.... Will there still be money coming out of that coal mine? Until I find it... Goho goho....
0x0F72|Grrrr...
0x0F73|Goho goho.... If your life is at stake, don't go into a coal mine. When a strange gas appeared, monsters started appearing... Goho goho....
0x0F74|You guys! Quickly move away before you end up like the person next door.
0x0F75|tree! I? My job has always been to take care of everyone.
0x0F76|. You shouldn't leave sick people behind.
0x0F77|Minea: It's not just gas, but monsters as well...
0x0F78|Minea: It's not just gas, but monsters as well...
0x0F79|No reply. It looks like it's just a piece of paper...
0x0F7A|My grandfather's only purpose in life was making gunpowder, but he was forbidden to do that. Since then, I have completely lost my energy...
0x0F7B|I'm a master at making gunpowder. However, making gunpowder was banned from the castle. If you want gunpowder, it's still in the mine, so take it with you. Goho goho....
0x0F7C|Minea: The gunpowder is in the coal mine...
0x0F7D|Manya: "Inside the mine, does that mean we're heading towards the source of the gas? Manya: "Huh...I'm really relieved just to be going underground.
0x0F7E|Minea: The gunpowder is in the coal mine...
0x0F7F|Manya: "Inside the mine, does that mean we're heading towards the source of the gas? Manya: "Huh...I'm really relieved just to be going underground.
0x0F80|I'm tired. Please let me rest. Throughout the day, I was tending to the injured... Please come again tomorrow. Goho goho....
0x0F81|This once lively town is now... My wife also fell asleep in this town... I also plan to bury my bones in this town.
0x0F82|Minea: Hey, sis. I wonder if there's anything more painful in this world than the death of a loved one...
0x0F83|No reply. It looks like it's just a piece of paper...
0x0F84|Be careful! There are a lot of monsters here!
0x0F85|Minea: Our next goal is King Leo's castle.
0x0F86|Manya: “Come on, let’s get out of here as quickly as possible!
0x0F87|Minea: It's not just gas, it's also monsters... Why? I wonder if they're somehow related.
0x0F88|Minea: ``What the person just said is true. There are signs of monsters floating around.
0x0F89|Manya: It's gasy, it's dark, and the monsters are annoying? Manya: I hope that in my next life, even if I make a mistake, I won't have to end up in a place like this...
0x0F8A|All of my many friends died. I'm also thinking about leaving this town soon. Goho goho....
0x0F8B|It is engraved with the words, ``Forever be the souls of the brave men of the mines.''
0x0F8C|Minea: Our next goal is King Leo's castle.
0x0F8D|Manya: “Come on, let’s get out of here as quickly as possible!
0x0F8E|Minea: It's not just gas, it's also monsters... Why? I wonder if they're somehow related.
0x0F8F|Whether gas or monsters appear, I'll do my best until I get the money! Ah, dig, dig, dig!
0x0F90|Did you come to get gunpowder? If so, there's a gunpowder pot in that box. Take it with you. However, it's probably the only one that can be used for anything other than making a flashy sound.
0x0F91|Minea: Our next goal is King Leo's castle.
0x0F92|Manya: ``Come on, let's get out of here as quickly as possible! You're going to die from inhaling too much gas.''
0x0F93|Manya: ``My head looks bad, but in a way it's kind of fun.''
0x0F94|Minea: It's not just gas, it's also monsters... Why? I wonder if they're somehow related.
0x0F95|Oh my God! Do you want to own your own store? Then you should leave this town. You can't do big business in a small rural town like this. I'd like to buy a store in Endor and invite my family over... Damn! It's good to have dreams!
0x0F96|Good night....
0x0F97|Hey, do you need something? If you're from my house, the shop is open during the day, so come by at night.
0x0F98|I heard the rumors. I heard you bought a store in Endor. Wow, that's a big deal. You're a rising star in this town.
0x0F99|I heard the rumors. I heard you bought a store in Endor. Wow, that's a big deal. You're a rising star in this town.
0x0F9A|Oh, Torneko? If you're a merchant, you should have your own shop. However, there is no place in this town to open a new store.
0x0F9B|Tom: No, thank you. My son is back, too. Tom: Maybe it was God's guidance that led you to meet him. Thank you.
0x0F9C|I heard that Old Tom's son has come home. I'm really glad.
0x0F9D|old tom runs the town
0x0F9E|I come here every day to pray for my son to come home.

0x0FA7|Nene: "Hey... We'd like to own our own shop someday, too. Nene: You're not the kind of person who will always be used by others. Nene: That's why I married you. Of course, that's not all. Uhu.
0x0FA8|Nene: "Oh? You still have your old lunch box? Well then, I'll replace it with a new one.
0x0FA9|Nene: “Oh? Do you have a lot of things to bring? Well, I guess I’ll stop for today.
0x0FAA|Nene: ``Yes, this is your lunch. Good luck today too.''
0x0FAB|Nene: Good morning, you. It's already morning.
0x0FAC|Nene: "Oh, welcome back. You must have had a hard time at work. Nene: Please take a good rest. Good night, dear...
0x0FAD|Popolo: ``I'm mumbled...'' Daddy, please come...
0x0FAE|Nene: ``When you leave the house, don't fall asleep and walk straight west. Well, do your best today too.''
0x0FAF|Nene: ``When you leave the house, don't fall asleep and walk straight west. Well, do your best today too.''
0x0FB0|Nene: ``You're finally awake. Yes, this is your lunch.
0x0FB1|Nene: ``How long are you going to sleep? If you don't go to the store soon, your boss will scold you again.'' Nene: ``Hey, if you...''
0x0FB2|This is Lakenava, a small town far north of Endor. A man named Torneko lived in this town. Right now, he's just being used by others, but Toruneko's dream was to save up money and become the world's number one weapon shop.
0x0FB3|There is a child's doodle book. Every page is filled with cute animal pictures.
0x0FB4|Lawrence: ``Mr. Torneko is truly a happy person.
0x0FB5|Scott: ``Your wife is beautiful... I feel the injustice of the world.''
0x0FB6|You were late! Come on, let's go inside the store! We're inside!
0x0FB7|I've reconsidered the idea of ​​owning a store in Endor. Torneko. After all, I was looking at a beautiful woman, and I was looking at her, and I was thinking, ``It's about time for the added destruction...''.
0x0FB8|Mr. Torneko. I wish you success.
0x0FB9|Okay, Thomas, it's been a pain. Now go back to the cage!
0x0FBA|Well, if you want to return it, please come any time. Because I'm here.
0x0FBB|Hello Torneko. What happened? Did he come to give the dog back?
0x0FBC|Thomas! Listen carefully to what Mr. Torneko says!
0x0FBD|Mr. Torneko! It's me, Tom's son! Thanks to you, I'm back. That's right, I have to thank you. But I don't have anything on hand right now... picture? what? I'd like to thank you, but could you lend me your dog, Thomas? Oh, how easy it is. This dog is good at hunting foxes, so I'm sure it'll come in handy.
0x0FBE|Tom: "Oh, Torneko! My son has come back! Tom: I guess it's all because I went to church every day and prayed for him to come home..." Tom: "I can't do this. Torneko, will you please push me to church?
0x0FBF|Hey Torneko! Are you heading home now? When I get home, a beautiful lady will come and meet me. I'm so jealous! Konchikusho!
0x0FC0|Mr. Torneko, please join me in praying to God for world peace. If the world were to end, Mr. Torneko wouldn't be able to do business at all.
0x0FC1|Hey Torneko! Is Nene doing well? I'm just curious as to why such a beautiful woman would marry someone like you. Even though I'm all alone... I'm so jealous! Konchikusho!
0x0FC2|Thomas: “Wan wan wan!
0x0FC3|Wan wan wan!
0x0FC4|Popolo: Oh, Papa. You know, the guy at the inn said he had something to talk about.
0x0FC5|Welcome to the town of Lake Nava! Huh? What is it, Torneko? It was a waste of time to say welcome.
0x0FC6|Tom: See you then.
0x0FC7|Torneko got <GOLD>G!
0x0FC8|Tom: Hey, I'm at church. I'm sorry. Please accept this.
0x0FC9|Tom: “Hey, what’s going on? Why don’t you press harder?
0x0FCA|Tom: “I see… That’s a shame.
0x0FCB|Tom: ``Then give me a firm push.''
0x0FCC|Tom: ``Oh, Torneko, you've come to the right place! There's something like what you just did.'' Tom: ``This old Tom has gotten weak in his legs because of his age... Going to church is a pain. Tom: ``I'll thank you later, so can you push me to church?''
0x0FCD|Please do not remove the flowers from the flower pods.
0x0FCE|Lawrence: There's a weapon shop in Lake Nava that has a strangely large number of customers... Lawrence: Huh? Is that where you used to work?
0x0FCF|Scott: “Hmm. Are you from this town? Yeah, it’s a pretty nice place!”
0x0FD0|Thomas: “Coooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo so much.
0x0FD1|Thomas: “Wow, wan wan wan!
0x0FD2|Tom: Your son is back and working seriously. Come on, I'm so happy. Tom: Your son? He's in the doghouse in the back.
0x0FD3|Tom: The dog in the background is my son's dog, and it only listens to what my son says... Tom: Poor potato, he's in the cage.
0x0FD4|Wow, you have great eyes! You'll become a good businessman! Well then, thank you.
0x0FD5|What, I don't need it... Well then, let's try something else.
0x0FD6|{7f17}But I can't seem to get this one. <GOLD> How about G?
0x0FD7|Yeah, I can't help it. Let's say you go to another store.
0x0FD8|Actually, I want to sell you a weapon, but would you buy it?
0x0FD9|I guess it's no good after all... You got in my way.
0x0FDA|Thank you very much. I'm going to give it to someone I know. See you then.
0x0FDB|Oh my God! I can't seem to equip this. Will you still sell it?
0x0FDC|Oh? Wait. It seems like he had a lot of belongings. I'll either sell it somewhere or throw it away, so please take care of it!

0x0FE9|I look forward to seeing you tomorrow too.
0x0FEA|Torneko got <GOLD>G!
0x0FEB|It's already late today, so the store will be closing soon. It must have been a lot of work. Look, today's salary.
0x0FEC|Does this store want to do business? How long are you going to make me wait?
0x0FED|I see. Well, I'm sure you have a lot of things you want to do, too. It can't be helped even if you keep being used by me... Understood! I'll do my best. And if you want to work here, you can always come back.

0x0FF0|Then come here quickly.
0x0FF1|What, was that so? Okay, I understand!

0x0FFD|Hakushon! The embarrassing story has turned into a story about how to sell it.
0x0FFE|The village is over. Madoru's best selling business, oh
0x0FFF|Nyoagiri Teaka Don Gaade and so on...
0x1000|Then I thought maybe the ground would still be broken. I heard that Don Gaade went to repair the bridge, but I wonder what happened.
0x1001|Oh no, is that so? It must be a lively place.

0x1003|Have you been to Ise Doll yet?
0x1004|Hoho…. Is it your dream to be in the world's best weapon shop? So, I've gathered up some experience in battle, and I've been able to assemble items to my satisfaction, and I can't say that I'm the best weapon shop in the world...

0x1016|There is a book called ``True Horror Stories.'' When I picked up {7f4b} and read it, I got lost in the forest and ended up in a strange village.
0x1017|The villagers were kind and hospitable to strangers' merchants.
0x1018|I even offer to give it to you. The troubled merchant gratefully accepted the offer.
0x1019|In the morning, I went to the village.
0x101A|I'm going to have a good time in the morning. When I woke up, there was a bridge. Then all traces will be erased.
0x101B|Apparently there's a fox around here that can disguise people. Please be careful.

0x104C|I have something more important to do than show you how to win!

0x104E|Oh, are you a greengrocer? picture? Is it a weapon shop? oh dear! This is the kitchen!
0x104F|Apparently, a guy called Don Gaade repaired bridges all over the place. Thanks to this, I was able to go both north and east.
0x1050|The women's chatter is so rambling that I can't follow it.
0x1051|Be careful of Despisaro!
0x1052|Good, good. There are so many dishes to wash!
0x1053|Lawrence: In the end, it was the Princess of Santheim who won. Lawrence: What would have happened if Despisaro and Princess Alina had fought in a martial arts tournament?
0x1054|Scott: I suspect that Despisaro's disappearance was a conspiracy by the other contestants. Scott: Isn't the winner, the Princess of Santheim, particularly suspicious?
0x1055|Scott: ``Watch out for Despisaro?...What does that mean?''
0x1056|Unfortunately, I can't go in here. Go away.
0x1057|Since the martial arts tournament has ended, this place will be closed for a while.
0x1058|So I guess you're here to sell. However, new merchants will not use it unless there is an emergency. It's about giving up.
0x1059|In that case, it's better to go inside than this door.
0x105A|Are you a merchant who serves the castle?
0x105B|Mummy... There's nothing abnormal about it...

0x1069|I wonder what kind of person a hero is... That's really fishy.
0x106A|Hohohoho. A large sum of money
0x106B|I put it in. Whatever you do with that money is up to you, but use it for your future.
0x106C|Only after paying for all the weapons and armor. Do your best to collect them.
0x106D|The king also has a lot of things to think about, so he probably doesn't even think about weapons.
0x106E|Hey, are you a weapon shop? It seems like there are a lot of powerful weapons these days. However, in this castle, the soldiers still use some kind of sword. That's pathetic...
0x106F|In the last martial arts tournament, a man named Despisaro almost won... Despizarro disappeared midway through. I wonder who he was.
0x1070|It seems that the princess of this country, Princess Monica, has a gentleman who secretly has feelings for her. Who exactly is this...? Ah, I'm already worried about work.
0x1071|I can't stand it.
0x1072|It seems that a loophole to the castle town is hidden somewhere in this castle... I've been working here for many years, but I've never seen such a loophole.
0x1073|Grrrr...
0x1074|I didn't expect him to come into the castle this late at night! Now that I've discovered it, I can't remain silent. Sasa, leave!
0x1075|The king will sit on top of this.
0x1076|A large picture is displayed. It appears to be something that conveys the history of the kingdom.
0x1077|Lawrence: “Emperor of Hell and the World”
0x1078|Are you a hero...? That's incredible.
0x1079|Scott: After all, rumors aren't worth it. Scott: Well, in any case, it has nothing to do with you, a merchant. There's nothing to worry about.
0x107A|Lawrence: ``You must be a first-rate merchant to succeed in such a big business.'' Lawrence: ``I'm sure you can put that money to good use for your future.
0x107B|Scott: 60,000 gold, huh? That's a lot of money! Have you thought about how you'll use it? Scott: Why don't you try making me an idiot for 750 days?
0x107C|Lawrence: ``Oh, that power covers the heavens~ A man who fears even God. His name is Despizarro~♪'' Lawrence: ``When I saw Despizarro's match, I tried to compose a song about him.'' Lawrence: ``...I know. I don't have any talent for poetry. That's why I learned magic...''
0x107D|Scott: ``I saw that Despizarro match too. He was overwhelmingly strong.
0x107E|Apparently, a long time ago, there was something called a sword in the sky. It is said that whoever held the sword could ascend to heaven. What on earth does that mean?
0x107F|King: Torneko! It was a real pain in the ass to procure weapons and armor for the soldiers! King: By the way, if you're a weapon shop, you've probably heard rumors of the Sword of the Sky. King: It's said to be the strongest sword that can crush any rock. King: If such a thing really exists, I definitely want to get it...
0x1080|King: It has been said for some time that our soldiers are not reliable. King: Torneko. I hope you do a good job in procuring weapons and armor.
0x1081|King: "Oh, Torneko! I hear you've finally opened a shop. King: This is my congratulations! I'll order it for you right away! King: I want you to buy weapons and armor for the soldiers in the castle and deliver them to the people in the room below. King: My orders are 6 steel swords and 6 pieces of iron armor! King: I'll give you the details from the soldier commander in the room below. Listen.
0x1082|King: ``Tornekko! From now on, you'll continue to contribute to business for the sake of the world and for people.'' King: ``And if you open a store, please let me know as well.''
0x1083|King: ``Oh! Torneko! Good to see you back! King: ``I've already received the news from Bonmor.'' King: ``Thank you for your hard work! I'll allow you to open the store as promised!''
0x1084|King: ``Send my letter to King Bonmor! You asked for it so much.'' King: ``Now is not the time for people to fight each other.'' King: ``If you can stop the war with your work, I'll even allow you to open a store!''
0x1085|King: ``That's good! There are so many people asking for that forgiveness, and in fact, I'm in trouble, too.''
0x1086|King: ``I understand your wish. Let's think about it! Now, step back.''
0x1087|King: ``Thank you for taking the long way to ask me how you are!'' King: ``You look like a merchant, but are you asking for permission to open a shop here in Endor?''
0x1088|Monica: It's like a dream to be allowed to marry my beloved Rick! Monica: My name is Torneko. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
0x1089|Monica: I'm sure your father has some good ideas. I believe in him.
0x108A|King: ``Thank you for asking.
0x108B|King: ``My pretty daughter, Monica. I heard your story too.'' King: ``But you don't need to worry!'' King: ``My name is Torneko. Could you please deliver this letter to the king of Bonmoor?''
0x108C|Monica: “Wang Soo So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So So We Have To So So So So So! We have to inform our father so quickly!
0x108D|{7f43}My dear Monica, Princess of Endor. Days passed without me being able to tell my father about you. What's even more frightening is that my father seems to be planning to invade your country, Endor. We have to do something before that happens. Please let your father know about this...
0x108E|{7f4b} read the prince's letter.
0x108F|Monica: “Did you come from Lake Nava? Well, then, the broken bridge has been repaired.
0x1090|My King will meet anyone, regardless of their status. I hope it doesn't happen.
0x1091|The king and princess are already on vacation.
0x1092|This is King Endor's room.
0x1093|There is a book called ``The Wonderful Colosseum.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Our Colosseum in Endor was built by the current king. It is popular among the people for its martial arts tournaments and various other events planned by the king. Bloody, meaty, dancing battle! A play full of dreams and romance! All entertainment is at the Colosseum!
0x1094|There is a book called ``Secret Exchange Diary.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Cute Monica. I thought of you 50 times today. The centerpiece of your breakfast, the pillars of the castle, the cat in the garden, the fish in the pond, and the grass on the roof all look like your face. The world is full of Monica! Good luck Monica! As always, I'll send this diary to Endor via a secret route. with love
0x1095|Lawrence: ``I thought arms dealers make money by starting wars, but...'' Lawrence: ``You're stopping a war, and you're making a profit yourself. In fact, that's a big deal.
0x1096|Scott: "Good for you! You're lucky to be able to do business with this Endor.
0x1097|The king and princess finished their meal and went to bed. Now I have to clean it up. Sesse Sesse.
0x1098|I need to wipe the table clean. Sesse Sesse.
0x1099|There is a high quality painting on the wall.
0x109A|It's rumored that the monsters starting to appear are a sign that the Emperor of Hell will come back to life. But it's just a rumor... How true is it...?
0x109B|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x109C|No, no, this statue of the goddess makes me go crazy every time I see it. However, rumor has it that a long time ago there was something called a Sword in the Sky. No matter how much I spend, I want to get it...
0x109D|Hmm, maybe it's not good.... But if you change your mind, you can always come and sell!
0x109E|Torneko obtained 25,000G!
0x109F|Oh thank you! I certainly received it!
0x10A0|somewhat! What you're holding there might be a silver goddess statue! ? 20000... No! Let's get 25000G! Can you sell it to me?
0x10A1|My hobby is collecting old things. I heard that there is a silver goddess statue sleeping somewhere. No matter how much I spend, I want to get it...
0x10A2|Good night....
0x10A3|Among all the books that seemed to be difficult, there was one book that said, ``Aim to be a popular man! Beginner's edition''...
0x10A4|Lawrence: It's true that the silver goddess statue is a valuable item, but it's of no use to you. Lawrence: I won't say anything bad about it. Just sell it.
0x10A5|Scott: ``I understand that you don't want to sell the treasure you worked so hard to obtain, but it won't be of any use to you if you keep it.Scott: ``Since you're willing to buy it at a high price, why don't you sell it to me?''
0x10A6|We've been rich for a long time, so my husband buys all kinds of strange things. Still, I couldn't use all the money... Ohhohohoho.
0x10A7|The old man in this house is a strange person, always looking at the sky.
0x10A8|It is a relief with elaborate workmanship.
0x10A9|It is decorated with expensive-looking armor.
0x10AA|Nene: "Welcome back. Thank you for staying up so late. Nene: Please take a good rest. Good night, you...
0x10AB|Nene: "Oh, welcome back. You must have had a hard time at work. Nene: Please take a good rest. Good night, dear...
0x10AC|Popolo: ``Ah, Papa! Welcome back! Yeah. Ku: You've been a good boy. Popolo: ``When you grow up, you'll be like your father, make money, and make your father and mother happy!''
0x10AD|Popolo: ``Wow, Papa, that's amazing! You finally have your own shop! Wow, yay!
0x10AE|That's how Torneko finally got his own shop and invited his family over.
0x10AF|oh! Will you buy it? ? Well, from today onwards, this store is yours! Be sure to focus on your business!
0x10B0|But you
0x10B1|I don't have that much money. Don't make fun of the elderly.
0x10B2|I see... That's a shame...
0x10B3|picture? Is the store downstairs closed? Ah, I'm already old too. I would like to sell this shop and use the money to retire... Why don't you buy this store for 35,000G?
0x10B4|picture? Is the store downstairs closed? Ah, I'm already old too. I would like to sell this shop and use the money to retire... It seems like there is no one who has received permission from the king to do business, but also wants a store...
0x10B5|Nene: “It’s okay.
0x10B6|Even if you don't lie down and comfort me... Nene: “I am also a sword in the sky.
0x10B7|I heard something. That's what I'm trying to find... Nene: ``You're the kind of person who can't live without always having some kind of dream...'' Nene: ``That's why I fell in love with you, too.'' Nene: ``Come on, you! I'll be waiting for you forever!''
0x10B8|Nene: ``I understand, you. I won't say anything anymore.'' Nene: ``You're the kind of person who can't live without always having some kind of dream...'' Nene: ``That's why I fell in love with you, too.'' Nene: ``Come on, you! I'll be waiting for you forever!''
0x10B9|Nene: Welcome back! I just received the news that the cave has opened! Nene: But I don't know what that means... Nene: I can't believe you... Now that you've opened your own shop, are you planning to go on a journey again?
0x10BA|Nene: Welcome back! Thank you for your hard work every day. Nene: By the way, I heard that a casino has opened! Nene: I think it's okay to take a break once in a while.
0x10BB|There is a book called ``Happy life with puns''. I picked up {7f4b} and read it. The key to good health, the key to happiness, a happy marriage, and good business The source of everything lies in puns. Instead of good morning, instead of good night, have a nice pun and a cheerful laugh. Aim to be popular in town! Fortune comes to those who laugh.
0x10BC|There was a letter stuck between the books. {7f4b} read the letter. Dad, how are you? It's time to close up shop and live with us. He's already old and I'm worried about him being a father alone. from your beloved daughter
0x10BD|Lawrence: ``I've been waiting forever!...I see. I also want to be told just once.'' Lawrence: ``Oh? Kao...
0x10BE|I understand. Fufufufu….
0x10BF|Scott: ``You must be a sinful man to leave such a cute wife behind and go on a journey.Scott: ``But if I say so myself, I don't think calling yourself a sinful man suits you.''
0x10C0|Lawrence: If you're a merchant, wouldn't it be a good idea to think about owning your own shop? Lawrence: Oh... it wasn't for me to say anything.
0x10C1|Scott: ``I think it's a good idea to be able to buy a vacant store here!''
0x10C2|Nene: "Welcome back. Thank you for staying up so late. Nene: Please take a good rest. Good night, you...
0x10C3|Nene: "Oh? You still have your old lunch box? Well then, I'll replace it with a new one.
0x10C4|Nene: “Oh? Do you have a lot of things to bring? Well, I guess I’ll stop for today.
0x10C5|Nene: ``Yes, this is your lunch. Good luck today too.''
0x10C6|Nene: Good morning, you. It's already morning.
0x10C7|Nene: "Oh, welcome back. You must have had a hard time at work. Nene: Please take a good rest. Good night, dear...
0x10C8|Nene: ``Okay, I'll take care of the store, so you can buy all kinds of items.'' Nene: ``When you talk to me from across this table, I'll leave the items in the store.
0x10C9|Nene: ``Now, please take a good rest. Good night, you...''
0x10CA|Nene: “Are you tired already today? If so, it’s a bit early, but do you want to rest now?”
0x10CB|Nene: ``Well, you're wonderful! This is our store. It's like a dream!'' Nene: ``From today on, I'm going to work hard for the rest of my life! Nene: Let's work together and make this store the best in the world! Nene: You... I love you... Thuu.
0x10CC|Nene: ``I'll take care of the store, so you can buy all kinds of items.'' Nene: ``When you talk to me from across this table, I'll make sure to leave the items in the store.
0x10CD|Nene: "It's okay. You don't have to comfort me with such a lie..." Nene: "I also heard the rumor about the Sword of the Sky. I guess that's what you're trying to find..." Nene: "You're the kind of person who can't live without always having a dream..." Nene: "That's why I fell in love with you, too. Nene: "Come on, you! I'll be waiting forever!

0x10D2|Scott: ``You must be a sinful man to leave such a cute wife behind and go on a journey.Scott: ``But if I say so myself, the word ``sinful man'' doesn't suit you.

0x1175|There is a book called ``100 Tips for Saving Money''. I picked up {7f4b} and read it. When you walk down the street, keep your head down. If you have money lying around, put it in your pocket. Let's sell lost items to the store. Never lend money to anyone. The money lent will never be returned. If that's the case, let's borrow it instead. When shopping, try green onion as much as possible. Even if the shopkeeper cries or gets angry, don't give up on half the price.
0x1176|There are slot machines. Would you like to try it?
0x1177|I'm Ryan, a warrior of Batland. Ryan: ``I came to see if the person I was looking for was at a martial arts tournament, but...'' Ryan: ``The martial arts tournament has already ended, and I hear this casino will be closed for a while.
0x1178|Well, luck will come soon. Be patient here and do your best!
0x1179|Okay, then I'm going to be bullish. I'm bullish when I'm winning!
0x117A|What do you think? Are you already making money?
0x117B|oh! Even if you win today's earnings, the coins will not turn back into money. The smart thing to do would be to enjoy yourself with the extra money without going overboard.
0x117C|Once you have enough coins, you can exchange them for goods at the exchange on the right.
0x117D|I can't seem to catch up today.
0x117E|Yay! Double up and 8 cards become 16 cards! I'm addicted to it!
0x117F|Welcome to the casino. Only coins can be used here. Please buy coins at the cashier there.

0x121E|Rumor has it that people have disappeared from the western country of Santheim.
0x121F|Lale: "Scott... If the goddess statue is in a cave, it would be nice if they could get it quickly... If it were my people, I'd be so nervous... Grrrr...
0x1220|Lawrence: ``That's a shame. If you change your mind, please come again.''
0x1221|Lawrence: ``Hey, can you take it for me?'' Well, let's go.
0x1222|Lawrence: ``But it seems like you don't have enough money. Please save up some money before you come.''
0x1223|Lawrence: ``I'm a traveling poet, but I've trained and can now use magic.'' Lawrence: ``Why don't you try killing me with 600G for five days?''
0x1224|Awawa, was that so...? Please pretend you didn't hear what I just said. Wahahaha.
0x1225|Actually, I am too. If you get it, I'm sure it will sell for a high price. Wahahaha.
0x1226|Hey, you're also a merchant. So you too can get the Silver Goddess Statue?
0x1227|Scott: ``Well, that's too bad. If you change your mind, you can come back again.''
0x1228|Scott: ``I see! Can you do it for me? Come on, I'll follow you wherever you go!''
0x1229|Scott: ``But it looks like you don't have enough money. You should come back.''
0x122A|Scott: But I don't like dogs. Scott: If you borrowed a dog, you should return it.
0x122B|Scott: It seems that there are still great treasures in the caves, but there are also terrifying monsters living there. Scott: How about you? Why don't you make me your bodyguard for 5 days with 400G?
0x122C|Lawrence: I've been to Santheim myself. Lawrence: I can't believe people are disappearing from that peaceful country... Is this a sign of something to come?
0x122D|Scott: Come to think of it, I've heard rumors like that too. It might be the work of monsters.
0x122E|Lawrence: ``Do you think 600 gold in 5 days is expensive?'' Lawrence: ``No, no. I don't want you to underestimate my magical power.'' Lawrence: ``Well, if you actually spend 5 days with me, you'll understand my ability.''
0x122F|Lawrence: Unfortunately, the promised five days have passed. Well, that's it for me. Good-bye...
0x1230|Scott: "Oh! Looks like the promised five days have passed. I'm sorry, but I have to say goodbye here. Scott: "Then be careful. Farewell!
0x1231|North from here is Komis Village.
0x1232|The bridge belongs to everyone. Let's not break it.
0x1233|From here
0x1234|Village of Tempe.
0x1235|Do not mess around in the forest.
0x1236|If you find someone suspicious, go to the castle! King Butland
0x1237|Lawrence: ``Finally, it's the fifth day. Shall we go back to some town?''
0x1238|Scott: ``Oh, it's already the fifth day! But don't worry, I'll stay just a little longer.''
0x1239|Lawrence: It's already the fourth day. I can't believe I only have a short time left.
0x123A|I feel like it's left behind. Lawrence: What do you think? Why don't you come back to Endor and have me again?
0x123B|Scott: "What, it's already the fourth day? I don't feel like I've worked very hard. Scott: "I feel like 400 gold isn't enough.
0x123C|Lawrence: Today is the third day... Time passes faster than you think.
0x123D|Scott: It's already the fourth day. Scott: What? It's only the third day!? ... Oh, now that I think about it, you're right. I'm sorry, I was wrong.
0x123E|Lawrence: ``One day has passed. Only four days left...'' Lawrence: ``No, no. It's not like I'm looking forward to the end of work...''
0x123F|Scott: ``It's already been a day since you've been complaining. I hope we can take it easy.''
0x1240|Lawrence: ``It's been a short five days, but I appreciate your continued support.
0x1241|Scott: Look, look. Five days will go by in the blink of an eye if you're fussing around.
0x1242|Mummy... Thanks to the monster, the armor is selling well and selling well... Heh heh.
0x1243|This is an armor shop, but ever since monsters started wandering around, the armor has been selling and selling... It seems that ordinary people want armor to protect themselves more than weapons. That's why it's out of stock. I'm sorry.
0x1244|King: "That's what you meant!?" King: "If my son Rick becomes King Endor's daughter Muco, then Rick will be the next King of Endor!" King: "We can get Endor even if we don't attack anything!" King: "Thank you for your hard work. I'll send someone to help you right away, so you can leave.
0x1245|{7f43}Dear King of Bonmor. This is sudden, but I want you to listen to what I have to say. Apparently my daughter Monica and your son Rick are in love. I don't want to say it right away, but I would like to get them married... From the King of Endor
0x1246|{7f4b} read the king's letter.
0x1247|King: My son Rick is the next King of Endor!
0x1248|King: As expected of Don Gaade! As soon as he arrived, he repaired the bridge and went on his way. King: Now we can finally attack Endor! Wahahaha!
0x1249|Rick: I heard from your father. If you go to Endor, please tell Monica. Rick: I can't wait for the day I can marry you...!
0x124A|Rick: ``I've been asking you a lot about that letter.
0x124B|Architect Don Gaade finally came. With this, the broken bridge should be repaired soon! Good, good.
0x124C|Entry into the castle is prohibited at night. You can come again tomorrow.
0x124D|Endor is a rich country. It had been the king's long-held dream to acquire that country.
0x124E|King: "Yes! Don Gaade is here yet!? Where on earth is he picking roadblocks? King: "If we don't repair the bridge quickly, we won't be able to invade the land of Endor!
0x124F|Rick: “…….
0x1250|This is the prince's room. This is not a good place for arms dealers to come.
0x1251|Sasa! Get out!
0x1252|Prince! Prince! Don't talk to such merchants.
0x1253|Rick: ``I'm Rick. I'm the prince of this country.'' Rick: ``I guess I thought you were a traveling merchant...'' Rick: ``I'll tell you the details at night, behind the weapon shop.''
0x1254|This is the prince's room. This is not a good place for arms dealers to come.
0x1255|Even if I wanted to go to Endor, I couldn't because the bridge was broken. Even though I could immediately fix the architect's sloppy work... I wonder if you could come soon.
0x1256|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x1257|Books on imperial studies and history books are neatly lined up.
0x1258|Lawrence: It's terrible! The country of Bonmor is trying to start a war on Endor! Lawrence: Even though I'm a wanderer, I like Endor. We have to do something about this...
0x1259|Scott: "King Bonmor is planning to start a war on Endor? Scott: "Don't make me laugh. There's no way our Endor will lose to such a small country!
0x125A|Lawrence: ``That's disgusting!! That was a completely rude person! Not only you, but me...'' Lawrence: ``Oh, no, I'm talking about you.''
0x125B|Scott: What's that? You're talking about us like we're dirty!
0x125C|Rick: Hmm. But it looks like you can't have any more. Rick: Either sell it somewhere or throw it away and come back.
0x125D|Rick: I heard from your father. If you go to Endor, please tell Monica. Rick: I can't wait for the day I can marry you...!
0x125E|Oh my God! It seems that the man from Lake Nava who was in prison has escaped! No one paid any attention to me, though, because I was a complete idiot.
0x125F|Rick: As soon as the bridge is repaired, please deliver that letter to the Princess of Endor. Rick: The fate of two countries is at stake! I'm begging you!
0x1260|Rick: ``Okay, I asked you.
0x1261|Rick: "Oh, you've come. It's me. I'm Rick, the prince of this castle. Rick: Actually, if the bridge is repaired, I want you to go to Endor as soon as possible. Rick: And please give this letter to the princess of the castle.
0x1262|Prince! The prince was gone. flustered…….
0x1263|I'll be back tomorrow, but that's okay.
0x1264|I can't afford to go into a castle this late at night!
0x1265|I came to Bonmoor looking for work, but it's a barge for a castle town. Ah, Endor is the best when it comes to working.
0x1266|Did you come from Lake Nava? Come to think of it, there was also a man from Lake Nava in the castle's prison. If you want to talk to him, you'll have to think about it before the jailer sees you.
0x1267|Go south to Endor. I had only been there once before the bridge was destroyed. Come to think of it, there was an old man in Endor who wanted to sell his shop.
0x1268|Welcome to the castle of Bonmor.
0x1269|Lawrence: I heard that the king of the Bonmoor country is quite ambitious... I feel a little scared.
0x126A|Scott: Is this Bonmaur? It's quite a small castle.
0x126B|Tom's son threw away the chimera's wings!
0x126C|{7f43}Hey, thank you! I know! I'll start working seriously when I get back to the village. Well then, I'll be heading back to the village as soon as possible!
0x126D|{7f43}Don't say that and leave!
0x126E|{7f43} Torneko! It's Torneko, right? It's me! It's me! That's old Tom's son. I was really saddened by the fact that I made a mistake and ended up here. There's no way anything bad is going to happen. You were a merchant. If that's the case, go ahead and buy some chimera wings. picture? Do you already have it? Then give it to me! I'll pay my respects when I get back to the village!

0x1270|I can't see the man in there anymore, but I guess he's sleeping somewhere in the back.
0x1271|I am the greatest thief in the world! But the person being put in there must be a stingy thief. Apparently it came from Lake Nava.
0x1272|This is a prison! You can't talk to prisoners! Now get out.
0x1273|Who are you! ?
0x1274|This is a prison! You can't talk to prisoners! Now get out.
0x1275|Customers... please don't break things in other people's homes too much.
0x1276|Recently, monsters have become stronger, so many castles seem to be buying weapons and armor. Wow, I'm jealous of you, the weapon shop guy. I'm sure you'll make a lot of money.
0x1277|It seems like there's been a fox that turns people into humans recently. However, if you bring a dog, such as a fox, you should be able to get rid of it.
0x1278|I heard that castles are buying armor at high prices these days. I don't like it. I hope we don't get too wet during the war...
0x1279|Thomas: “One!
0x127A|Lawrence: This doesn't seem to be a natural cave. I can see traces of human intervention here and there. Lawrence: Maybe it was built to hide something important?

0x1382|This is a princess. We are currently repairing the wall, so please be patient for a while.
0x1383|A portrait of the deceased Queen Santheim is hung here.
0x1384|The mountains of Santheim territory are vividly depicted.
0x1385|It looked like it was in disrepair as it had only been repaired with a board. Do you want to hide the wall?
0x1386|It looks like they are repairing the hole with a board.
0x1387|Bligh: Is it at least a relief that the princess is safe? But there's a problem...
0x1388|Bligh: The king, the ministers, and the soldiers are all left behind.
0x1389|Clift: The whole castle went to Endor to celebrate the princess's victory... No, that's not true. Clift: If that's the case, then we should have had news too. Then where did she disappear to?
0x138A|Alina: They're not here either... Why? Hey, where did everyone go?
0x138B|Alina: ``Both the minister and your father are thinking too much. We need to be more cheerful!'' Alina: ``I'm the one who cured your illness, so come on, let's do it!''
0x138C|Bligh: Why don't we quickly cure the king's illness with the nectar of that song?
0x138D|Clift: ``It looks like we'll somehow be able to escape without even the rest of the country knowing.''
0x138E|Alina: I'm back in my room! I'm back, a little stronger!
0x138F|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x1390|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x1391|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x1392|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x1393|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x1394|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x1395|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x1396|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x1397|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x1398|Bligh: I don't think we'll be able to stop the princess unless she uses an iron wall instead of a board...Sigh.
0x1399|Alina: "It's not my fault. It's my fault that the walls break easily. Right?
0x139A|Bly: Hmm. It seems like the people in the castle haven't changed much.
0x139B|Clift: Is it okay for someone of my status to enter the king and princess's room...?
0x139C|Alina: ``My room! I see you've kept it tidy. I'm glad.''
0x139D|Bligh: ``The late queen was a graceful and beautiful person.'' She grumbled.
0x139E|Clift: ``This person doesn't understand. The tomboyish nature of Princess Alina...'' Clift: ``What? I didn't say anything!
0x139F|Alina: Tomboy, Tomboy, I get calluses on my ears.
0x13A0|Bly: Hmm. It seems like the people in the castle haven't changed much.
0x13A1|Clift: Looks like the King is taking a break now.
0x13A2|Alina: “Sometimes I just want to sleep soundly in a fluffy bed in a castle.
0x13A3|Clift: ``I'm a priest, so I can't really destroy the wall.'' Clift: ``As expected of a princess! It's amazing!''
0x13A4|Bligh: ``The late queen was a ladylike and beautiful person.'' she grumbled.
0x13A5|Alina: "It's not my fault. It's my fault that the walls break easily. Right?
0x13A6|Bly: Hmm. It seems like the people in the castle haven't changed much.
0x13A7|Clift: Is it okay for someone of my status to enter the king and princess's room...?
0x13A8|Alina: ``I don't have any use for castles anymore. Now, let's go on an adventure!''
0x13A9|Alina: “Sometimes I just want to sleep soundly in a fluffy bed in a castle.
0x13AA|Bligh: ``This is a big deal! What the heck is going on!?''
0x13AB|Anyway, it was great! However, I'm curious about the dream the king had...
0x13AC|By order of the king, I have given you permission to pass through the shrine to Endor. Please take care of yourself.
0x13AD|King: ``Please be careful as you continue on your journey.'' King: ``I'm going to think about my dreams.'' King: ``When I had that horrible dream, I feel like I had another dream as well, but I just can't remember it...''
0x13AE|King: ``I won't stop you now. Do as my daughter Alina wishes.'' King: ``Tell her that your father told you to see the world with your own eyes!''
0x13AF|King: "Arena. I won't stop you now. See the world with your own eyes." King: "Clift to Bligh. I asked for Arena!
0x13B0|King: "Oh!? I can hear it! I'm healed! I'm healed! King: I see. You guys... Anyway, let's thank you. King: Actually, I had an incredibly horrifying dream. King: A gigantic monster had risen from hell and was destroying everything. King: At first I was planning to keep it in my chest, but... King: It's too much. I keep having the same dream over and over again. Something makes me feel uneasy. King: As soon as I tried to tell the minister about my dream, I stopped speaking. King: Maybe something is about to happen...
0x13B1|King: ……. King: Huh? Ah, ah.
0x13B2|This country is owned by a king. Please keep this a secret so as not to make anyone feel anxious...
0x13B3|Oh, my God! I never thought I would lose my voice! I tried not to let anyone else in the castle know about this, but if things continue like this... Oh, that's right! That's right! Old man Gon, who lives in the room in the backyard, might know something!
0x13B4|It's hard! In fact, the king's voice has stopped coming out!
0x13B5|The king looks at me as if he wants to say something.
0x13B6|king"…………………….
0x13B7|Ah, good. Good luck and be safe....
0x13B8|Bligh: ``Princess! You need to be a little more feminine. Bligh: Oh, mama, mama! Tebuma was a very elegant person. Bligh: As the princess's tutor, this old man doesn't have the face to match the king.
0x13B9|Above this is the bedroom of the king and princess.
0x13BA|This is the castle of Santheim.
0x13BB|somewhat! The princess...! We must bring the princess back to life no matter what! I asked!
0x13BC|The king said this because he was thinking of the princess. I hope you can understand.
0x13BD|King: ``Oh, Alina! What a pitiful figure... That's why I said so much...''
0x13BE|King: "Oh, you're back. Alina. King: No, you don't have to say it. It's about you anyway, so even if I stop you, I'm sure you're going to leave right away. King: But I won't just go to another continent that my eyes can't reach.
0x13BF|King: ``Oh! You heard me! That's why you're my cute daughter. You can rest in your room.''
0x13C0|King: "No, no! Why are you so tomboyish...?
0x13C1|King: What's wrong, Alina? Do you still want to go out?
0x13C2|King: "Oh, Alina!? I heard from my grandfather that you want to go on a journey to save yourself..." King: "No, no, no. You're a woman. Moreover, you're the princess of our country. King: How dare I go to the outside world where monsters live to save you! King: "Okay!? You're not allowed to leave this castle. Well then. It's okay to go down...
0x13C3|{7f43}Princess! Princess Arena! Your father is calling!
0x13C4|Once upon a time, in a certain place, there lived a tomboyish princess called Princess Arena. Every day, the king of the country is puzzled by the princess's tomboyishness. One morning, he called for the princess...
0x13C5|Bligh: "That's what that soldier said in his last words! Noooo.
0x13C6|Bligh: Is it at least a relief that the princess is safe? But there's a problem...
0x13C7|Clift: ``God is hiding...? No, my god would never treat me this badly. Clift: If it's not God... then...''
0x13C8|Alina: ``No, they're all hiding somewhere, aren't they? They're trying to make fun of us.''
0x13C9|Alina: ``I came to tell your father that I won. But why?'' Alina: ``Dad... why aren't you here?
0x13CA|Bri: I won't let you do anything to the princess with your black eyes!
0x13CB|Clift: ``I can't believe you lost your voice because of a horrible dream. What kind of...?''
0x13CC|Alina: "It's a dream, isn't it? I don't care about that! Hey, it's fine.
0x13CD|Bligh: I guess we'll be saying goodbye to the castle of Santheim for a while, hmm.
0x13CE|Bligh: ``I wonder if I'll feel better if I go to Endor... No, I'm sorry. The princess isn't that kind. Bligh: Grumbling... I need to get a special pension from the king. Grumbling...
0x13CF|Clift: First, let's go to Endor. After that, we'll go wherever the princess wishes!
0x13D0|Clift: ``I'll take you anywhere in the world! Ah...I'm so happy.''
0x13D1|Alina: First, let's win the martial arts tournament in Endor... Where should we go next?
0x13D2|Alina: ``I'm free! I can go anywhere in the world now. I can go on adventures forever! Alina: ``That's amazing. The whole world is much, much bigger than Santheim, isn't it? That's amazing!
0x13D3|Bligh: ``The princess's tomboyishness helped me this time.Sometimes things are rare.
0x13D4|Clift: ``This will cure the king's illness...'' Clift: ``No, I have to be happy. This is for the country. It's also for the princess...''
0x13D5|Alina: Now, all you have to do is make your father drink the nectar of this song! Alina: But, father, you don't like sweets. You have to force him to drink it, even if you have to pry his mouth open!
0x13D6|Alina: Your father is in his room.
0x13D7|Bligh: What do you mean? I thought I could finally go back to the castle! Bligh: Hmm... I can't refuse the king's request, and the princess is so dangerous... Bligh: Well, I'm done. Let's go wherever I want! Now, to Endor!
0x13D8|Clift: ``I can't believe how happy the princess would be if she heard that!'' Clift: ``Ah, I can travel with the princess again.''...Jeez.
0x13D9|Bligh: What do you mean? I thought I could finally go back to the castle! Bligh: Hmm... I can't refuse the king's request, and the princess is so dangerous... Bligh: Well, I'm done. Let's go wherever I want! Now, to Endor!
0x13DA|Clift: ``I can't believe I get to travel with the princess again... I'm crying, what should I do?''
0x13DB|Alina: ``You can see the world with your own eyes.'' So, you can go to Endor! You can also participate in the martial arts tournament! Alina: ``I did it! I did it! Now, let's go. This time, I'll go through the main gate with dignity!''
0x13DC|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x13DD|Alina: “I made everyone worry a lot, but it’s okay now!
0x13DE|Bly: ``Hmm. Gon old man. You're doing quite well.
0x13DF|Alina: "Minister, old man Gon. Thanks to Maroni, your father's illness will be cured! Alina: Of course, it's also thanks to Bligh and Clift.
0x13E0|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x13E1|Clift: Oh God! Thank you for protecting the king.
0x13E2|Alina: Now, all that's left to do is make your father drink the nectar of this song! Alina: But, father, you don't like sweets, right? Even if you have to pry your mouth open, let him drink. Leave him alone, just leave him alone.
0x13E3|I hear you. Poor thing....
0x13E4|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x13E5|Alina: ``Your father is in his room. Ah, father...''
0x13E6|Clift: Old man Gon certainly knows a lot. Come on.
0x13E7|Let's do it!
0x13E8|Alina: ``I'm sure I'll cure your father. I'll definitely cure him.''
0x13E9|Bly: Hmm... I hope it's just an illness. But this... I grumble.
0x13EA|Clift: ``We have to do something before the people of this country notice this incident.''
0x13EB|Alina: "Soon. Soon. I'll heal your father right away! Alina: Come on!
0x13EC|Let's.
0x13ED|Bligh: ``I see deceptive signs around the king. Who are they doing? Hmm...''
0x13EE|Clift: ``The king's heart. You can tell by looking at his eyes.'' Clift: ``I will protect the princess even if it costs me my life!''
0x13EF|Alina: ``Father, please wait just a little longer. Next time you come back, I'm sure.'' Alina: ``I'm sure Alina will cure your father of his illness!''
0x13F0|Alina: Everyone, please wait. Next time we return to the castle, I will heal your father!
0x13F1|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x13F2|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x13F3|Alina: Father, Alina will heal you right away. Alina: Until then, please stay healthy...
0x13F4|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x13F5|Alina: ``Your father is in his room. Ah, father...''
0x13F6|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x13F7|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x13F8|Bly: Oh my god, old man Gon! Hmm. I'm sure he knows something!
0x13F9|Clift: "Old man Gon in the backyard? I've never met him, but...
0x13FA|Alina: ``That's old Gon in the backyard. If you meet that person, I'm sure you can cure your father's voice!'' Alina: ``Let's go!
0x13FB|Come on! !
0x13FC|Bly: Hmm... I hope it's just an illness. But this... I grumble.
0x13FD|Clift: ``I've never heard of such a disease. Losing your voice!''
0x13FE|Alina: “I lost my voice!? I never expected something like that to happen!”
0x13FF|Bligh: ``I see deceptive signs around the king. Who are they doing? Hmm...''
0x1400|Clift: “King… I’m here.
0x1401|Alina: “Why doesn’t your father tell me anything? What happened? Hey!
0x1402|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x1403|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x1404|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x1405|Alina: “Father, you look so pained? Oh, father….
0x1406|Bligh: ``The nights come earlier than in 2019. Ah, I'm sleepy. Ah, it's painful. I mumble.
0x1407|Clift: ``Thank you for all the hard work of your soldiers, even this late at night.
0x1408|Alina: “It looks like it’s time for your father to take a break. I think I’m a little sleepy too…”
0x1409|Bligh: ``The king is too sweet. I would appreciate it if you could stop the princess.'' He grumbled.
0x140A|Clift: The king is more concerned about Princess Alina's safety than anyone else.
0x140B|Alina: ``Alina, you've become so strong...I wish you could praise me.'' Alina: ``Father, you should be more enthusiastic about your daughter's changes!''
0x140C|Bligh: If it were a normal princess, she would have gracefully climbed onto that throne. Bligh: I guess this old man was brought up poorly... No, no, that can't be the case. He grumbled.
0x140D|Alina: No matter what anyone says, I won't go back to the castle just yet.
0x140E|Alina: I think I've become a lot stronger during my travels. Alina: I wonder if it's time for your father to allow me to go to another continent?
0x140F|Bligh: ``When you're traveling with a princess, no matter how many lives you have, it's never enough.
0x1410|Alina: “The minister and your father are both worried.
0x1411|That's it. I want you to believe in me.
0x1412|Bligh: If it were a normal princess, she would gracefully sit on that throne. Bligh: Why, my princess...... grumbling...
0x1413|Bligh: ``Sigh... I've just become the princess's tutor, so I'm going through a lot of trouble.''
0x1414|Clift: ``Thank you for all the hard work of your soldiers, even this late at night.
0x1415|Alina: “It looks like it’s time for your father to take a break. I think I’m a little sleepy too…”
0x1416|Alina: “Ministers are really noisy, aren’t they? It’s better than Bligh though.
0x1417|Bligh: ``The king is too sweet. I would appreciate it if you could stop the princess.'' He grumbled.
0x1418|Clift: ``The king gave me permission to travel around the continent with Princess Alina...'' Clift: ``Oh, how lucky I am! Ugh, I'm crying.''
0x1419|Alina: ``You should travel with me, father.'' Alina: ``If we do that, we can go anywhere in the world! Your father will be able to see us.''
0x141A|The king seems to be nodding off sometimes in the middle of the night. It's like I'm having a bad dream...
0x141B|Please take care and continue your journey.
0x141C|I have heard from the king. Please pass by.
0x141D|The king's voice is no longer heard! ? oh! oh! It's the end of this country! ………………. No, I was so distraught that I apologized for the inconvenience. Come to think of it, the poet Maroni also had a sore throat in the past... But now she has the most beautiful voice in the country. Maybe you know something.
0x141E|My name is Gonji. It's a carefree, inactive situation. Hohohoho.
0x141F|Oh, this is a princess. My name is Gonji. It's a carefree, inactive situation. Hohohoho.
0x1420|Climb these stairs to reach the throne room. However, the king is already on vacation.
0x1421|Hmmm. Then the local princess goes on a journey. Of course I won't tell anyone. After all, I'm famous for my hard mouth. Wahahaha.
0x1422|This is this. I was just talking about a princess.
0x1423|Grrrr... Ah, Princess, you can't... Mummy...
0x1424|Ah, I'm so depressed, I'm so angry. ``Why is this princess so tomboyish... no, she's so cheerful?''
0x1425|Something is bothering me and I can't sleep. Oh God. Amen.
0x1426|Climb these stairs to reach the throne room.
0x1427|Climb these stairs to reach the throne room. Ah, Princess Arena! Good luck.
0x1428|If the world finds out that the princess has gone on a journey, bad guys might target her.
0x1429|What a princess...! Oitawasiya....
0x142A|Ah, Princess Arena. Good luck and good luck.
0x142B|Ah, I'm so depressed. I wonder if it'll be time for dinner soon.
0x142C|Please forgive me. That person is a nice person, but he has a bad attitude.
0x142D|I'm a traveling merchant, but the princess of this castle is said to be an extremely tomboyish person. I'd like to meet you once. Wahahaha.
0x142E|Come on, I have to prepare the meal. Ah, it's so busy.
0x142F|Lately, there has been a strange presence floating in the eastern sky. Oh God! Please protect this castle of Santheim. Amen.
0x1430|Clift: ``I heard from my old man, Mr. Bligh, that Princess Alina is planning to go on a journey alone. Clift: ``Please don't do something like that!'' Clift: ``If something were to happen to the princess, Clift...or rather, the king, I'd be disappointed!''
0x1431|somewhat! Good to see you back!
0x1432|I hope you can return to your room.
0x1433|Due to the king's orders, we cannot allow them to pass through here.
0x1434|It is a landscape painting depicting mountains in spring.
0x1435|There are delicious-looking dishes lined up on the table.
0x1436|There is a theological book called ``Faith and Prayer.'' It seems like something is stuck between the books. A hidden bromide of the arena has appeared!
0x1437|Bligh: "That's what that soldier said in his last words! Hmm.
0x1438|Clift: Is this an illusion? Why is there no one here!?
0x1439|Clift: “This deceptive presence that remains faintly in the castle... What if...!
0x143A|Alina: ``No, they're all hiding somewhere, aren't they? They're trying to make fun of us.''
0x143B|Alina: "No one...? What do you mean? Where did everyone go?
0x143C|Alina: I wonder if they would be happy if I bought some souvenirs for your father and everyone else?
0x143D|Alina: ``Hmm. I can finally go out from the main gate and head out on my journey! Alina: ``It's fun to destroy walls, but this is nice and fresh.''
0x143E|Bligh
0x143F|I wanted to relax and sip the tea the woman made. Bligh: I had a pile of spell books that I had already read, so oh, exactly. I grumbled.
0x1440|Bligh: ``I wonder if I'll feel better if I go to Endor... No, I'm sorry. The princess isn't that kind. Bligh: Grumbling... I need to get a special pension from the king. Grumbling...
0x1441|Clift: First, let's go to Endor. After that, we'll go wherever the princess wishes!
0x1442|Clift: God bless the castle of Santheim...and the king and princess.
0x1443|Alina: ``When I don't go home for a while, I get a nostalgic look on everyone's faces at the castle.''
0x1444|Alina: ``I'm free! I can go anywhere in the world now. I can go on adventures forever! Alina: ``That's amazing. The whole world is much, much bigger than Santheim, isn't it? That's amazing!
0x1445|Bligh: ``I wonder if I'll feel better if I go to Endor... No, I'm sorry. The princess isn't that kind. Bligh: Grumbling... I need to get a special pension from the king. Grumbling...
0x1446|Clift: ``I'll accompany you wherever you go in the world! Ah...I'm so happy.''
0x1447|Alina: “The next time I come back, it will be when I won the martial arts tournament!
0x1448|Alina: First, let's win the martial arts tournament in Endor... Where should we go next?
0x1449|Bligh: Even the clumsy priest can sense something. Bligh: In order to prevent the country from becoming even more anxious, I'll give the honey of the song to the king as soon as possible!
0x144A|Bligh: ``Now I can relax in the lonely castle. I'm so tired. I'm so tired.''
0x144B|Clift: ``It's great that you made it back safely. God, I feel so grateful...''
0x144C|Bligh: ``The princess's tomboyishness helped me this time.Sometimes things are rare.
0x144D|Clift: ``This will cure the king's illness...'' Clift: ``No, I have to be happy. This is for the country. It's also for the princess...''
0x144E|Alina: ``Father, you'll soon be able to hear your voice like before.'' Alina: ``So please wait a little longer.
0x144F|Alina: Now, all you have to do is make your father drink the nectar of this song! Alina: But, father, you don't like sweets. You have to force him to drink it, even if you have to pry his mouth open!
0x1450|Bligh: ``If this happens, it can't be helped. We have to somehow get out of the castle and help the king!''
0x1451|Alina: “Already, already! I don’t understand! I just missed it!”
0x1452|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x1453|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x1454|Alina: Father, Alina will heal you right away. Alina: Until then, please stay healthy...
0x1455|Alina: Everyone, please wait. Next time we return to the castle, I will heal your father!
0x1456|Clift: Why is old man Gon living in a backyard like this? Clift: With his knowledge and personality, he could easily become the elder of the country.
0x1457|Alina: Just as Old Man Gon said, Maroni's story will be of great help to you, Father. I'll heal you soon. Please wait...!
0x1458|Bligh: Hmm. Even a casual poet can be useful once in a while. Do you want to go see Maroni?
0x1459|Clift: "I see. If you're a poet, you should know a lot about every disease. Let's go to Saran!
0x145A|Alina: ``Maroni? Is that Maroni in the town of Saran? Alina: Are you saying that person who sings all the time knows something? Alina: ``...But I don't have any other clues. Let's go!
0x145B|Bly: Hmm. Old man Gon. Are you still alive? You stubborn bastard.
0x145C|Alina: "Gon old man...I wonder which one is grandpa, Bligh?
0x145D|Clift: ``Oh, what a slut! What an enviable dream of a soldier!?'' Clift: ``Yes...! No, no, I'm sorry. It's nothing!''
0x145E|Bligh: Even the clumsy priest senses something. Bligh: In order to prevent the country from becoming even more anxious, I'll take the king!
0x145F|Bly: Hmm. After all, it's not a good thing for someone who is considered the princess of a country to go on a journey.
0x1460|Alina: Bad guys only need to aim for me! I'm strong. If it were me... Alina: Father...
0x1461|Bligh: We set out to the east, and many troubles befell the princess and the king. Bligh: Hmm...
0x1462|It would be nice if it were different.
0x1463|Alina: ``Well, now I have to follow my father's instructions.
0x1464|Bligh: Hmm. The matter of Flenor. And the King... I can't believe they're unrelated. Bligh: But what kind of person would be so afraid to aim for a princess or a king?
0x1465|Clift: Oh God! Please protect King Santheim!
0x1466|Alina: ``You don't know anything about your father.'' Alina: ``You're so careful not to worry me. Father...''
0x1467|Alina: ``I'm finally back at the castle. It's quite late, though.''
0x1468|Clift: ``I don't think I can trust the words of merchants that they have a hard mouth...''
0x1469|Alina: ``It seems like our many wonderful battles are being conveyed.
0x146A|Clift: Even though the monsters in Tempe Village have been exterminated...Is there still something out there?
0x146B|Clift: It seems like the king really doesn't want the princess to go out.
0x146C|Alina: ``You don't understand, father! Fine, I'll throw down the wall again and go outside!''
0x146D|Bly: Hohohoho, now you can't go back outside the castle.
0x146E|Alina: Hey! Don't block the road! I'm totally losing my mind.
0x146F|Bly: Hmm. After all, it's not a good thing for someone who is considered the princess of a country to go on a journey.
0x1470|Alina: Even if the bad guys try to target me, they'll hit me back!
0x1471|Bly: Hohohoho, now you can't go back outside the castle.
0x1472|Bligh: ``Sigh... I've just become the princess's tutor, so I'm going through a lot of trouble.''
0x1473|Bly: Hmm. It seems like the people in the castle haven't changed much.
0x1474|Alina: ``I don't like the tight shoes inside the castle.
0x1475|Alina: ``Everyone stays in the castle and doesn't get tired all the time.'' Alina: ``Don't you want to go out and have an adventure once in a while?''
0x1476|Clift: ``My nostalgic castle...'' Hmm, it's relaxing.
0x1477|Clift: ``I don't want too many people to know about the princess's journey.'' Clift: ``Well, she seems to have a hard mouth, so I don't think you need to worry.''
0x1478|Alina: “There are already rumors about us. Hehe, is that a sign of popularity?
0x1479|Bly: ``I have a rough idea of ​​what kind of rumor it is. Oh my...''
0x147A|Clift: ``Oh, what a slut! What an enviable dream of a soldier!?'' Clift: ``Yes...! No, no, I'm sorry. It's nothing!''
0x147B|Alina: ``On the other hand, I think I'm just an ordinary princess. It's a good thing that I'm energetic!
0x147C|Bligh: ``It's so pitiful to be a princess whose only goal is to be energetic.
0x147D|Clift: What is the priest's anxiety? I hope nothing happens to Princess Alina.
0x147E|Bly: Hmm. After all, it's not a good thing for someone who is considered the princess of a country to go on a journey.
0x147F|Alina: "The bad guys are targeting me..." Alina: "...Hehehehe. I have to do that! Ah, my arms are ringing~.
0x1480|Bligh: ``I can't believe that even a humble person would spread rumors like this. Wow, that's so lame.''
0x1481|Alina: "You're such a tomboy!? Excuse me. I'm the most tomboyish princess in this country!
0x1482|Clift: Don't worry, I will protect the princess, even if it means dying. Clift: No, of course I will protect you, Lady Bligh!
0x1483|Bly: Hmm. I wonder if there's something going on in the east. We have to be careful. Bly: I think the best thing to do is to stay out of this castle.
0x1484|Bly: Hohohoho, now you can't go back outside the castle.
0x1485|Clift: It seems like the king really doesn't want the princess to go out.
0x1486|Alina: ``You don't understand, father! Fine, I'll throw down the wall again and go outside!''
0x1487|Bligh: Look, princess. That's what the soldiers are saying, so please return to the castle.
0x1488|Alina: ``You don't understand, father! Fine, I'll throw down the wall again and go outside!''
0x1489|Bligh: ``Sigh... I've just become the princess's tutor, so I'm going through a lot of trouble.''
0x148A|Bly: Hmm. It seems like the people in the castle haven't changed much.
0x148B|Clift: “I feel kind of relieved when I come back to the castle.
0x148C|Alina: ``I don't like the tight shoes inside the castle.
0x148D|Alina: ``I don't have any use for castles anymore. Now, let's go on an adventure!''
0x148E|Meow meow meow!
0x148F|Meow.
0x1490|Clift: ``It's so sad that only one of them was left behind.''
0x1491|Alina: “If I understood what the cat was saying, I could have found a clue! Father...
0x1492|Bligh: Even though you received the king's permission, why did you not go through the main gate and come from a place like this... grumbling.
0x1493|Alina: After all, you should go back to your original intentions and kick the wall! Alina: The adventure started with that kick.
0x1494|Alina: “Looking at Santheim Castle at night again, it’s beautiful.
0x1495|Bligh: Even though you received the king's permission, why did you not go through the main gate and come from a place like this... grumbling.
0x1496|Alina: ``There's no need to beat up the wall anymore...but somehow you do it.''
0x1497|Alina: “From now on, I can travel anywhere I want. What a great feeling!
0x1498|Clift: ``I can't believe King Santheim is still gloating......I'm curious.''
0x1499|Alina: ``When I get upset at night, it's usually when I eat too much. Dad, you're picky...
0x149A|Bligh: Why don't we quickly cure the king's illness with the nectar of that song?
0x149B|Alina: ``Well, let's report to Gon-ji. I also want to thank him.
0x149C|Bligh: From now on, I won't let this old man stop me. Bligh: Let's go! And we'll help the king!!
0x149D|Clift: Oh, God! King Sama, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, king, and king, while we are away!
0x149E|Alina: “Oh, that cat seems to be doing well too. Hehe.
0x149F|Bly: ``I'm starting to feel sleepy now than I was this year. Fuwa~ I'm so sleepy.''
0x14A0|Alina: You can see the moon and stars clearly tonight. Alina: If I make the roof of the castle my room, I can sleep looking at the stars every night.
0x14A1|Alina: “Oh, there was a cat in a place like this. So cute.
0x14A2|Bligh: Normally, we should be relaxing and drinking tea in the castle, but why are you grumbling like this?
0x14A3|Alina: “The sun is so warm and feels so good. Hmm, nice weather!
0x14A4|Good night....
0x14A5|You can't. I am a servant of God. My body is dedicated to God.
0x14A6|I fell in love with this nun at first sight. I wonder if you'll marry me.
0x14A7|Clift: Yes, Maroni should be there already!
0x14A8|Arena: "Oh? That singing voice. I think it's Maroni. Where is it coming from?
0x14A9|Bligh: “This Bligh also had many nicknames when he was young.It’s so nostalgic.Hehehehe.
0x14AA|Clift: ``Are you sure you can't fall in love as a person who serves God?'' Sigh...
0x14AB|Bligh: ``Even if I die, I won't be able to die until the princess gets married!'' Bligh: ``However, I wonder when that will happen.'' I grumbled.
0x14AC|To the north of this town, deep in the mountains to the east, there is a small village.
0x14AD|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x14AE|Clift: How is everyone in Tempe doing?
0x14AF|Alina: The village deep in the mountains to the east is the village of Tempe, right?
0x14B0|Clift: How is everyone in Tempe doing?
0x14B1|Alina: The village deep in the mountains to the east is the village of Tempe, right?
0x14B2|Clift: The mountain path must be steep. I need to buy a lot of medicinal herbs.
0x14B3|Arena: “A village deep in the mountains to the east… You have to visit this place!”

0x1759|Let me tell you when it's time
0x175A|Let's come!
0x175B|Damn, Maroni's guy did such a good job. Ah, I wish I could sing as well as he does...
0x175C|law. A clear singing voice can be heard from everywhere. This seems like a good night's sleep.
0x175D|Grrrr...
0x175E|law? As a woman, on a journey with no power...? But for a while, I guess I'll just have to use my power around town.
0x175F|Bligh: There you are, you stupid poet. Sasa! Let's go! We need to hear from him!
0x1760|Clift: “That singing voice! It’s the people who are singing!
0x1761|Bligh: It would have been better if he hadn't said such a bad thing. Bligh: If he had just given up on traveling after being in such pain near the castle, he would be by now...
0x1762|Alina: ``I'm sure I'm stronger than this person! I want to fight him.''
0x1763|Bligh: ``I can't sleep well unless I'm in a quiet place.''
0x1764|Clift: I'm sure you'll have a good dream tonight.
0x1765|Bligh: ``What this person says is quite valid. It's dangerous to go out suddenly.
0x1766|Alina: “You’re such a rude person to women. I’m really strong!
0x1767|I'm finally getting into business. Thank you very much.
0x1768|Nina: I can't abandon this village where my father and mother are. Nina: Please, don't be sad. The sacrificed girls just won't come back... Nina: It's not decided that I'll die...
0x1769|I don't like it! To use Nina as monster food! If we both leave the village...
0x176A|Bligh: ``I'm not at all happy when a grumpy young man thanks me.''
0x176B|Alina: ``You'll be exposed as much as you want, and you'll be appreciated! You'll do good things, too.
0x176C|Bligh: Hmm, hmm. It is only when the folk are happy that the royal family can prosper. Bligh: You have done a good thing for a princess.
0x176D|Clift: What a kind person. God, please give us strength. We want to save this village.
0x176E|Alina: A sacrifice!? There's no need for that! Just defeat the monster! Alina: There's no need for this person to sacrifice himself. Let's do something about it!
0x176F|Bligh: ``Compared to men, you're so respectable. Bligh, I can't just ignore such a petty woman.
0x1770|Clift: What a kind person. God, please give us strength. We want to save this village.
0x1771|Alina: A sacrifice!? There's no need for that! Just defeat the monster! Alina: There's no need for this person to sacrifice himself. Let's do something about it!
0x1772|Bligh: If these two escape, what will happen to the remaining villagers? Bligh: That doesn't mean we have to help them.
0x1773|Alina: "I can't let you become food for monsters! I'll defeat you!
0x1774|Good night....
0x1775|No, you're a great person! What an incredible journey! In that case, you should participate in a martial arts tournament being held in the eastern country of Endor. You can reach Endor from the southeastern shrine of this country.
0x1776|At some point, a huge monster started crawling in the forest north of the village. The monster will destroy the entire village unless a young girl is sacrificed.
0x1777|It's been a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time since I've been in the middle of a long time. in this village
0x1778|Nina is now the only daughter I have.
0x1779|There is a book that says, ``Let's travel to the wonders of the world!'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. There are many wonders waiting for us in the world. A gigantic statue of a god, a giant statue that touches the sky, a closed kingdom, and many towns that cannot be found on any map. my words are true
0x177A|The travel party is
0x177B|Gabutani the big thing! ! The journey is great! Let's go on a journey! The world is waiting for you!
0x177C|Alina: ``You don't seem to have any idea that I won that martial arts tournament.''
0x177D|Bligh: ``A martial arts tournament is outrageous. Even this old man said something he didn't want.'' He grumbled.
0x177E|Alina: There's a martial arts tournament in the land of Endor!? Alina: Ah... rivals that Endor hasn't seen yet are calling me. Alina: Endor... I want to go to Endor. The martial arts tournament... I'm entranced.
0x177F|Bligh: ``The enemy looks tough. We need to keep our heads together.
0x1780|Bligh: Because of the monster, so many daughters...
0x1781|mosquito! Uzokuni Enakabli: “Oh! If only I had known about this sooner!
0x1782|Arena: “The monster is in the northern forest! Let’s go!!
0x1783|Sooooo.
0x1784|I was just talking about you with my daughter. Come to think of it, I think I've seen it somewhere before... Was that when you went to the castle? Hmm, I can't remember.
0x1785|Nina: Thank you very much. Please take care and continue your journey.
0x1786|I had already given up, but I didn't receive any words of gratitude. thank you very much.
0x1787|I will never forget this kindness!
0x1788|Nina: “We’re getting married!
0x1789|What kind-hearted people are willing to take on the task of exterminating monsters! The church priest knows the details. Please come and meet the priest!
0x178A|Hmm Nina.... Hmm.
0x178B|I guess so...
0x178C|How you! ? From what I saw, it didn't seem very strong... No, now I'm clinging to straw! If this is true, please come and meet the priest!
0x178D|For the sake of the village, my daughter's knee is nanana nanana nanana naranada.
0x178E|It is saranan. oh! Isn't there someone strong enough to exterminate the monster somewhere?
0x178F|Clift: “I’m jealous.
0x1790|Clift: No matter how you disguise yourself, a princess's precious possessions cannot be hidden.
0x1791|Alina: "Is that a good thing? Please keep the fact that I'm a princess a secret!
0x1792|Bligh: ``If possible, I'd like to end my trip already.'' I grumble.
0x1793|Alina: ``Good. Nina-san, you look happy.
0x1794|Bligh: But, are you really happy being together with that arrogant man?
0x1795|Clift: “I’m jealous.
0x1796|Alina: ``Good. Nina-san, you look happy.
0x1797|Bligh: ``I'm sure you're feeling anxious, but first you need to get ready. Bligh: Your physical condition, equipment, and everything else needs to be in tip-top condition. Don't let your guard down.
0x1798|Alina: Come on! Let's go to church! I can't accept that it's a sacrifice. We're going to defeat the monster.
0x1799|Bligh: Village Chief, I totally understand how you feel, but... Bligh: Sadly, we don't stand a chance of winning right now. What a pity...
0x179A|Clift: If we save Nina, Princess Alina will be in danger...Oh, what should we do!
0x179B|Alina: ``I want to help everyone in the village, but it's dangerous for us right now.'' Alina: ``We have to somehow become stronger before Nina-san is sacrificed!''
0x179C|It's a beautiful moonlit night. It's been years since I've had such a peaceful feeling...
0x179D|Woof woof, woof!
0x179E|I never thought I would actually be able to defeat that monster! I was completely surprised. You saved my daughter...no, you saved this village! The owner of the tool shop also started doing business as before, and the village of Tempe was revived. Although it's an empty village, the items sold at the tool shop will surely come in handy on your journey. Thank you very much.
0x179F|The creature is gone now, isn't it? Wow, yay.
0x17A0|This is the village of Tempe. My dead daughter will finally be able to rest in peace.
0x17A1|Grrrrrrrrr….
0x17A2|The village chief's only daughter, Nina, becomes a sacrifice. My son was supposed to marry Nina soon... It's not very commercial.
0x17A3|Hey, you came here to take out some bad monsters! Wow, yay.
0x17A4|This is the cursed village of Tempe. My daughter wouldn't have died if she hadn't been born in this village...
0x17A5|An Idomaneki appeared from inside the well! !
0x17A6|<NAME> peered into the well.
0x17A7|An inscription on the tomb prayed that the girls who died for the village may rest in peace.
0x17A8|Bligh: ``I'd like to make sure the king and everyone in the castle are safe as soon as possible. Let's hurry!''
0x17A9|Bligh: ``Well, I'm feeling better on the mountain roads this year. I'm tired, I'm tired.''
0x17AA|Clift: What exactly did the soldiers who died in Endor want to convey...? Clift: In any case, let's return to the castle quickly!
0x17AB|Alina: What happened to everyone in Santheim? Alina: To your father, to the minister. To old man Gon, to the priest... Everyone is fine, right? They're fine, right?
0x17AC|Clift: God, please continue to protect this village and Princess Alina...
0x17AD|Alina: “From now on, everyone will be able to sleep peacefully and soundly.
0x17AE|Clift: Even children like this were frightened by monsters.
0x17AF|Alina: ``The monster in this village is gone now. Thank you...'' Alina: ``Come on! Let's go. Let's continue our journey.''
0x17B0|Bly: The owner of the tool shop seems to be feeling better. Hmm. I'm glad.
0x17B1|Alina: ``I'm going to telegraph my thanks. But it was really nice...''
0x17B2|Clift: ``Let's pray to God too. For peace in the village and for the souls of our daughters to rest in peace.''
0x17B3|Alina: ``Even if you defeat the monster, those who died won't come back...'' Alina: ``If I had escaped from the castle sooner, I'm sure I could have saved you.
0x17B4|Bly: I hope the princess doesn't get carried away by this. She grumbles...
0x17B5|Bligh: ``Well, I've answered better than this year. Ha, I'm tired, I'm tired.''
0x17B6|Clift: ``Let's bring joy to the daughters who died.''
0x17B7|Alina: Monsters really weren't that big of a deal. Alina: Am I too strong?
0x17B8|Clift: ``I'm more than happy to see everyone's bright smiles.''
0x17B9|Alina: “The village has come back to life. Yay!
0x17BA|Alina: I'm sure the reason we went on this journey was to save this village!
0x17BB|Clift: Oh, if only we had known about this village sooner...
0x17BC|Alina: ``I'm going to take this person's daughter's Kataki, and pray for the good fortune of Muramuramuramuramuramuramuramuramuraroiwa...and tell her that she'll be able to pass the year.'' Bligh: ``Your physical condition, your equipment, and everything else must be in top condition. Don't let your guard down.
0x17BD|Clift: ``If something were to happen, I would have to protect Princess Alina even if it meant my life...'' grumbled.
0x17BE|Alina: Come on! Let's go to church! I can't accept that it's a sacrifice. We're going to defeat the monster.
0x17BF|Alina: The monster from the north forest is tormenting this village. Alina: But it's okay now. Now that I'm here, I won't let you do what you want!
0x17C0|Clift: Are you saying that the people of the village are being tormented by monsters? Clift: You monster... What a drumstick!
0x17C1|Arena: “A monster!? This is our turn after all!
0x17C2|Bligh: This is the village of Tempe...Hmm. Is that what you mean?
0x17C3|Clift: ``To lose your daughter first... What a sad fate.
0x17C4|Alina: ``The Cursed Village is quite scary.'' Alina: ``We need to hear from more people!
0x17C5|Bly: I can feel it. There's a terrifying presence waiting for us deep within the village!
0x17C6|Bligh: It seems like there are a lot of things going on in this village. Hmm.
0x17C7|Clift: ``Many graves at the entrance to the village... I have a bad feeling.
0x17C8|Alina: We came to this village as nameless travelers. Alina: Please keep the fact that you are a princess a secret. Okay? I understand!
0x17C9|Alina: ``Everyone in this village looks sad. Let's give them strength!''
0x17CA|Two people who love each other are separated... That's sad.
0x17CB|Clift: No matter who it is, I can't forgive someone for tearing apart lovers!
0x17CC|Bligh: It seems like there are a lot of things going on in this village. Hmm.

0x184F|So let's leave it at that. Take care, traveler.
0x1850|Oh my God! Thank you for being a princess! I had also heard rumors that he was going on a trip!
0x1851|You don't look like normal people to me. Are you a person of status?
0x1852|If you go east through this forest, you'll find Flenor.
0x1853|The news that the monster had been defeated quickly spread throughout the village. And then the night dawned....
0x1854|Bligh: ``I'd like to make sure the king and everyone in the castle are safe as soon as possible. Let's hurry!''
0x1855|Clift: ``What the soldiers who died in Endor wanted to convey to us is that we should take care of them. Let's return to the castle as quickly as possible!
0x1856|Clift: ``Thus, Princess Alina's splendor spread throughout the country...Jeez.''
0x1857|Alina: Well, I don't mind revealing my true identity to just one person.
0x1858|Alina: “This time it’s Frenor! It’s my first time going to the east. I’m looking forward to it!
0x1859|Bligh: Oh, you idiot poet, tell me something stupid...
0x185A|Bligh: ``The monster's presence has completely disappeared. Now I feel more at ease.''
0x185B|Clift: Let the souls of the daughters who died before the altar finally rest in peace.
0x185C|Alina: I delivered a deadly kick to the monster here.
0x185D|Bly and Clift have joined the group!
0x185E|Clift: ``I'll be accompanying the princess as well! Now, let's go.''
0x185F|Bly: Princess! It's outrageous for you to go on a journey alone! If you insist, this old man will come with you!
0x1860|North from here is Komis Village.
0x1861|The bridge belongs to everyone. Let's not break it.
0x1862|East of here is the village of Tempe.
0x1863|Do not mess around in the forest.
0x1864|If you find someone suspicious, go to the castle! King Butland
0x1865|Bligh: ``A princess who won a martial arts tournament...'' She probably has princess-like titles like ``Beautiful'' and ``Taoyana.'' She grumbles.
0x1866|Bligh: If the worst happens, the princess is safe... Bligh: No! That can't be true. Bligh, it seems like you're overthinking it a bit.
0x1867|Clift: What exactly did the soldiers who died in Endor want to convey...? Clift: In any case, let's return to the castle quickly!
0x1868|Clift: ``As I'm walking like this, I'm reminded of all the incidents that happened in the past. Clift: ``The many successes of the princesses. Even now, my heart is pounding.''
0x1869|Alina: It's boring. There aren't any monsters! Alina: Are you hiding because you're scared because I look so strong? Still, it's boring.
0x186A|Alina: What happened to everyone in Santheim? Alina: To your father, to the minister. To old man Gon, to the priest... Everyone is fine, right? They're fine, right?
0x186B|Bligh: ``A princess who wins a martial arts tournament...'' She probably has princess-like titles like ``Beautiful'' and ``Taoyana.'' She grumbles.
0x186C|Bligh: If you're going to participate, you must win. Bligh: First, take your time and accumulate your powers! That's what we call cleverness.
0x186D|Clift: ``The princess wins in front of so many people gathered in the Coliseum...'' Clift: ``Oh, I'm starting to get teary-eyed with emotion.
0x186E|Clift: I hope the princess doesn't get hurt in the martial arts tournament.
0x186F|Alina: ``Fighting monsters is nice, but martial arts tournaments are much more exciting.''
0x1870|Alina: ``Let's quickly return to Endor and participate in the martial arts tournament. Hey!
0x1871|Bligh: Let's go anywhere, whether it's at the bottom of the sea or to the ends of the earth. Eh, anywhere!
0x1872|Clift: Endor and our country have a close relationship. I'm sure they will welcome you.
0x1873|Alina: ``First, we'll take part in a martial arts tournament. Then we'll go on an adventure all the way to the continent where Endor is.'' Alina: ``If you go around the world and come back stronger, your father will be surprised!''
0x1874|Arena: “I wonder what’s waiting for me in Endor? Hehehe, I’m looking forward to it!
0x1875|Clift: ``From now on, I'll be with the princess all over the world...'' What should I do? My face is red.
0x1876|Alina: ``Now that I have your father's permission, I feel refreshed! Now, let's get excited.''
0x1877|Bligh: ``Ah, well, now I can finally feel at ease. I can relax in the castle.''
0x1878|Braai: ``Hmm, hmmm. Princess, you did a great job. I've reconsidered this braai.
0x1879|Clift: ``It's easy to get relaxed on the way home and get unexpectedly injured. Please be careful.
0x187A|Clift: ``This will cure the king's illness, right? And so will our journey...''
0x187B|Alina: ``Father, it's almost time. I'll heal your illness soon.''
0x187C|Alina: ``I'm so busy going back and forth to Santheim.'' Alina: ``But I feel like my kicking power has improved a little bit thanks to you.
0x187D|Bligh: ``This is not the time to be on the wrong side! Come on, let's hurry!
0x187E|Bligh: If I were here, you'd be able to get honey from the chirping easily. Bligh: Leave it to this reliable old man!
0x187F|Clift: If we find the honey of the song, the princess and her journey may be over... Clift: No! I can't! Isn't that a joyous thing? The king's illness will be cured, and...
0x1880|Clift: Elves are a mysterious race. They are said to possess magic and various powers.
0x1881|Alina: ``Father. It must be really hard not being able to speak. Alina: ``We're the only ones who can help you. We'll definitely cure your illness!''
0x1882|Alina: ``The nectar of the chirping song might even be able to cure your father's illness. Alina: Let's hurry!
0x1883|Bligh: Let's go! To Saran town!
0x1884|Bligh: ``Well, just leave it as you are...my dear minister. I never thought you'd make us move! Bligh: If you go to the castle, we'll be able to talk quickly! You're so stupid!
0x1885|Clift: If something happens to the king, the princess will become the queen of Santheim. Clift: Will she become more and more out of my reach? Huh...
0x1886|Clift: Don't rush. If we get hurt, we won't be able to help the king.
0x1887|Alina: ``I don't think your illness will get serious, but... I can't take it easy.'' Alina: ``First, let's go to Saran! I have to talk to Maroni!
0x1888|Alina: It's the poet Maroni in the town of Saran! Everyone, hurry up!
0x1889|Bligh: ``Hmm. If we can stop traveling like this, we'll be successful. Bligh: The king has very good timing...Oops, I made a slip of the tongue.
0x188A|Clift: If something happens to the king, the princess will become the queen of Santheim. Clift: Will she become more and more out of my reach? Huh...
0x188B|Clift: Don't rush. Besides, you can't let us get hurt.
0x188C|Alina: ``I was just about to make the trip even more interesting!'' Alina: ``But I can't help it. Your father is more important. We can travel whenever we want.''
0x188D|Alina: “Father...
0x188E|Alina: What are you talking about? I've become much stronger again! Alina: I'll protect both Bligh and Clift. Don't worry.
0x188F|Bligh: Princess Alina, it's time to make up your mind to return to the castle. Bligh: After what happened in Flenor, it's dangerous to continue your journey any further.
0x1890|Clift: ``I brought sunscreen, a heat protectant, and a water bottle...'' Clift: ``Come on, Princess Alina! I'm fully prepared. Please tell me anything!''
0x1891|Bly: It's too dangerous for a princess of a country to travel alone... Bly: We have to get her back to the castle somehow!
0x1892|Clift: Night is the time for monsters. Please be careful. Clift: If we can't give you the golden bracelet, that girl won't survive.
0x1893|Bligh: I can't believe they'll keep their promise even if I give them the bracelet. Bligh: Maybe those fake people are Gurus too... No, am I overthinking this?
0x1894|Clift: If I give you the golden bracelet, I'm sure the villains will give you my daughter back. Clift: At night, at the graveyard in town. Come on, let's go!
0x1895|Arena: ``The battle is when you hand over the bracelet. Villains, look at me. I'll make you cry!''
0x1896|Alina: ``We have to hurry and get back to Frenor town! Hurry, hurry!
0x1897|Bly: It's too dangerous for a princess of a country to travel alone... Bly: Once this incident is cleared up, we have to somehow get her back to the castle!
0x1898|Clift: “When you step out of the cave, you can really appreciate the value of the sun.
0x1899|Bligh: ``Protect your own life first, rather than the life of a fake person. Don't be so reckless.
0x189A|Bligh: You villains. Bligh, no, you're using Princess Arena with your jaw! Bligh: That's totally unacceptable!
0x189B|Arena: ``The battle is when you hand over the bracelet. Villains, look at me. I'll make you cry!''
0x189C|Alina: Hurry up! We have to get the golden bracelet and save that girl!
0x189D|Bligh: You scoundrels. How dare you kidnap a young girl right in front of Bligh! Bligh: I'm sure you'll make me regret it.
0x189E|Clift: "If it wasn't for those people, the princess would have been kidnapped..." Clift: "Oh God! Please protect Princess Alina! And that girl too...
0x189F|Alina: ``I'll definitely save that girl from the villains. Okay!?''
0x18A0|Alina: “Wow! It’s too loud, Bligh. Even though I’m in a good mood!
0x18A1|Bligh: ``Doesn't the princess have any desire to take care of herself over the years? Bligh: Oh, I'm tired. Ah, I'm sleepy. Oh, my knees hurt too!
0x18A2|Alina: ``I'd like to participate in the martial arts tournament in the land of Endor someday. I'm enchanted...''
0x18A3|Alina: ``When I was in the castle, I would never have been allowed to go out like this at night.Alina: Let's walk, walk, walk like we did back then!
0x18A4|Clift: Princess Arena. Are you hurt? Clift: If you have any injuries, Clift will always take care of you!
0x18A5|Bligh: Wow, I'm tired. Princess! Please walk more slowly!
0x18A6|Bligh: If it were a normal princess, it would be okay for her to get homesick. She grumbled.
0x18A7|Bligh: I don't think traveling incognito is something a princess of her age would do. Bligh: It's pathetic that the only resemblance to the deceased queen is her face.
0x18A8|Clift: ``I admire Princess Arena's strength. Clift: ``Only strength! I'm of a different status.''
0x18A9|Alina: ``The world that used to be inside the castle is expanding more and more. It feels so wonderful.''
0x18AA|Bly: ``I've become more sleepy than I have in years.'' I grumble.
0x18AB|Clift: ``It's dangerous to walk at night.Maybe you should find a place to stay.''
0x18AC|Alina: ``A lot of monsters come out at night...'' Alina: ``Oh, my arms are ringing! Come on!
0x18AD|Bligh: Wow, I'm tired. Princess! Please walk more slowly!
0x18AE|Clift: Princess Arena. Are you hurt? Clift: If you have any injuries, Clift will always take care of you!
0x18AF|Bligh: ``That's quite troublesome for the princess.'' She grumbled...
0x18B0|Clift: ``To think I'll be traveling with the princess...'' Clift: ``I'm kind of excited. No, I don't mean that in a strange way!
0x18B1|Alina: ``Why the hell did you guys come with me?'' Alina: ``I thought I could just go on an adventure by myself!
0x18B2|Alina: ``No matter what my grandfather says, it will remain as it is...just as it is.''
0x18B3|The territory of Mizumi Deka Heim spans the entire continent. This is also my first time leaving the castle.
0x18B4|Arena: The outside of the castle is spacious and feels great! Arena: Come on! Monsters! Come at us from anywhere. We'll defeat them all.
0x18B5|Bligh: ``You don't buy a lot of things because you're too excited. Bligh: What do you need? Think three times before you buy it, and then buy it when you still want it!''
0x18B6|That princess was a fake. That's right. There's no way a real princess would come to a town like this.
0x18B7|Grrrr...
0x18B8|Good night....
0x18B9|By the way, a bazaar is being held at an oasis in the southern desert. If you ever go there, it would be a good idea to stop by. There may be some bargains.
0x18BA|Bligh: Damn you villagers! Why are you shouting unnecessary things like this one after another? Bligh: What's wrong with the desert! What's with the bazaar! Isn't it too late to return to the castle!?
0x18BB|Clift: The temperature in the desert is high and it's easy to get sick. I wonder if the princess will be okay.
0x18BC|Arena: “The bazaar of the southern desert! What a wonderful sound. Let’s go quickly!”
0x18BD|I can't sleep because I can't close my eyes. On nights like this, I can't help but remember things from the past. When I was young, I lived in Endor, the capital of the east. I used to go to martial arts tournaments a lot.
0x18BE|Apparently the innkeeper treated the princesses very well. I am also going to offer the princess a little bit of what I have.
0x18BF|Bligh: ``I hope I don't need you again...'' It's best if you don't talk to the townspeople for a while.
0x18C0|Alina: ``The martial arts tournament in Endor is calling me...'' Alina: ``But your father is far more important to me. I have no choice.
0x18C1|Bligh: ``I hope I don't need you again...'' It's best if you don't talk to the townspeople for a while.
0x18C2|Arena: I can't believe I've even seen an old man like that! Arena: Endor's martial arts tournament! I want to be there! I want to see it! I want to go to Endor!
0x18C3|Wan wan.
0x18C4|I hear there's a bazaar being held in the southern desert. Huh? Are you going now?
0x18C5|I hear there's a bazaar being held in the southern desert. Are your sisters going too? That's nice.
0x18C6|Hmmm.
0x18C7|In fact, I was trying to offer the princess a gift. But they refused... They say she was a fake, but I guess that girl wasn't that bad.
0x18C8|That princess was a fake. That's right. There's no way a real princess would come to a town like this.
0x18C9|This is the town of Frenor.
0x18CA|And just like that, the fake princess Mei and her friends disappeared from town. And then the night dawned....
0x18CB|Mei: Goodbye...
0x18CC|Mei: ``See you then. A real princess...''
0x18CD|Mei: Well, it looks like you've come to pick me up, so I'm going to go soon. Mei: I don't want to say thank you, but I'm going to give you the key to this tower.
0x18CE|Thank you for your help. Ah, it's hard to be a princess anymore. Sorry. I'm not really a princess.
0x18CF|I certainly received it! Then I'll give you back the princess. Abayo!
0x18D0|Are you saying it's okay even if the princess dies? Hurry up and give it to me!
0x18D1|It looks like you brought something you promised. Hurry up and get over here!
0x18D2|Hey, my dog ​​Koro just came with this letter in his mouth. I'll try reading it. If you want the princess back, bring this village's treasure, the golden bracelet, to the village graveyard tomorrow night. What is this? Yeah. I won't tell anyone.
0x18D3|Aon!
0x18D4|Meow Meow.
0x18D5|When you're a princess, you're bound to be targeted by bad guys. Oh, it's scary.
0x18D6|I wonder what the princess is doing these days... Oh princess...
0x18D7|I'm already surprised! Apparently, the princess who was in the inn was kidnapped! There are some people who do bold things... I guess the purpose is to get a ransom.
0x18D8|Wow, that's a big deal! The princess was kidnapped!
0x18D9|Hey. Don't you know where my dog ​​went?
0x18DA|One!
0x18DB|Hunyaaaaa.
0x18DC|Hmm. I thought how beautiful she must be since she was a princess, but I guess she's not that great...
0x18DD|ah! I want to get closer to the princess!
0x18DE|Did you also come to see the princess? Apparently it's on the second floor of this inn.
0x18DF|Apparently the innkeeper treated the princesses very well. I am also going to offer the princess a little bit of what I have.
0x18E0|Princesses, I wonder what their purpose is in this town!
0x18E1|This is Frenor. The princess of Santheim is coming to this town right now! I have to go see it soon!
0x18E2|A mossy grave stands quietly.
0x18E3|Bligh: ``I'd like to make sure the king and everyone in the castle are safe as soon as possible. Let's hurry!''
0x18E4|Clift: What exactly did the soldiers who died in Endor want to convey...? Clift: In any case, let's return to the castle quickly!
0x18E5|Alina: What happened to everyone in Santheim? Alina: To your father, to the minister. To old man Gon, to the priest... Everyone is fine, right? They're fine, right?
0x18E6|Bly: Hmm. So far, the town seems to be at peace. It's good, isn't it?
0x18E7|Clift: I'm sure the princess's smile will be reflected in the fountain's water, glittering along with the moon and stars... Clift: Wow. It's a beautiful night... Wow.
0x18E8|Alina: There was a shrine to the south of Frenor, right? Alina: It's where the travel door that leads to Endor is located! You can let us through this time.
0x18E9|Alina: "It's quiet... Is this normal?
0x18EA|Bly: Hmm. So far, the town seems to be at peace. It's good, isn't it?
0x18EB|Clift: ``If you sit back and look at it, it's quite a beautiful town, isn't it? Clift: ``We were just the two of us taking a walk around that fountain...'' No, it's nothing!
0x18EC|Alina: There was a shrine to the south of Frenor, right? Alina: It's where the travel door that leads to Endor is located! You can let us through this time.
0x18ED|Alina: It's been a while since Frenor. Today, my impostor is... What? He's not here. He's boring.
0x18EE|Bligh: But why do you like to go out in the middle of the night? Young people don't understand.
0x18EF|Clift: ``No matter the sky, God watches over our journey.''
0x18F0|Alina: “It seems like the moon and the stars are blessing us on our upcoming journey! It’s beautiful!
0x18F1|Bly: Let's hurry!
0x18F2|Alina: ``The desert bazaar seemed fun, but now it's not so much.
0x18F3|Bligh: Hmm. If you can return to the castle and stop traveling like this, you'll be successful. Bligh: The king has very good timing...Oops, I made a slip of the tongue.
0x18F4|Alina: ``The trip was about to get interesting!'' Alina: ``But I can't help it. I'm your only father.
0x18F5|Alina: ``I'm worried about my father. Come on, let's hurry!
0x18F6|Clift: I'm sure the princess's smile will be reflected in the fountain's water, glittering along with the moon and stars... Clift: Wow. It's a beautiful night... Wow.
0x18F7|Alina: "It's quiet... Is this normal?
0x18F8|Bligh: You damn kid, you're doing something stupid again... Bligh: You have to choose the villagers you talk to carefully. Grumbling.
0x18F9|Clift: ``I've heard about bazaars that travel around the world, but what about the real thing?'' Clift: ``I'm a little curious. The southern desert, huh?''
0x18FA|Arena: “Bazaar? Desert? Looks interesting! Let’s go!
0x18FB|Bly: Hmm. I wonder if that's what you do when you go to a roadside bank... No, no, it's nothing!
0x18FC|Clift: Whether it's the old man or the fake party, God's blessings are always available to those who are upright.
0x18FD|Alina: Mei and the others were good people after all. Alina: Is it obvious that we're fake people?
0x18FE|Clift: ``I don't think a humble person would be able to appreciate Princess Alina's elegance.''
0x18FF|Alina: ``There's a real princess here, too.'' Hehehe, are you going to reveal her true identity?
0x1900|Bligh: If you don't come to this town, you won't get involved in an incident like that.
0x1901|It didn't happen. Bligh: Well, before that, to Tempe... to Saran... Oh no! It would have been better if the princess hadn't left the castle!
0x1902|Alina: Come on! I wonder what kind of town will be waiting for us next?
0x1903|Clift: ``If you sit back and look at it, it's quite a beautiful town, isn't it? Clift: ``We used to take a walk around that fountain, just the two of us...'' He's a nice old man. Ruhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa rather also to make a bad thing, it's a good thing or a bad thing.
0x1904|Bligh: I got the golden bracelet. Now I have to go to the graveyard. Oh, damn it!
0x1905|Clift: It seems like this child kept his promise and was silent to everyone. Clift: God bless those who keep their promises. Something good will surely happen to them.
0x1906|Alina: I'm glad it was a dog who gave me the letter and not this kid! I don't know what they did to me.
0x1907|Bligh: All you have to do is look at fake people a little bit. It'll be a good medicine. Bligh: Well, just so you don't die.
0x1908|Alina: "We might be at the graveyard already. Let's hurry!
0x1909|Bligh: There's no need to show mercy to impostors or villains! Bligh: If you feel like you're in danger, run away immediately!
0x190A|Clift: Are the bad guys watching us from somewhere in this town?
0x190B|Alina: It's finally time... Have you done your warm-up? Now, take a deep breath! Alina: I'm going to the graveyard with the golden bracelet!
0x190C|Bligh: ``I got the golden bracelet. Now I have to go to the graveyard at night. Oh, damn it!
0x190D|Clift: It seems like this child kept his promise and was silent to everyone. Clift: God bless those who keep their promises. Something good will surely happen to them.
0x190E|Alina: ``Thanks to this dog, I think we'll be able to save the girl somehow. We should be grateful.''
0x190F|Bligh: All you have to do is look at fake people a little bit. It'll be a good medicine. Bligh: Well, just so you don't die.
0x1910|Alina: “That girl... I wonder what she’s doing these days.
0x1911|Alina: ``That girl was kidnapped because of the golden bracelet.'' Alina: ``Such a common bracelet. What's thankful for it? Gold isn't even rare.
0x1912|Bligh: ``When it's daylight, Tendou-sama, you scoundrel, you're too embarrassed to show yourself.Bligh: Hmph! I need to kill time somewhere until nightfall.
0x1913|Clift: ``I was wondering if they had reformed their ways and returned my daughter...'' Clift: ``I guess it won't work out like that. I guess we'll just have to wait for the night.''
0x1914|Alina: ``Finally, I got the golden bracelet. All I have to do now is wait for night and go to the graveyard.'' Alina: ``And I have to save that girl from the bad guys!
0x1915|Bligh: ``Give me the golden bracelet...'' I have a bad feeling about it.
0x1916|Bligh: ``Hmph. So you decided to force troublesome things on us and get the treasure. Bligh: I'm angry, but apparently there's no other way but to do what you say.
0x1917|Clift: ``The village's treasure, the golden bracelet. It's a terrifying treasure that can bring misfortune. Clift: ``I hope the golden bracelet doesn't bring misfortune to the princess.''
0x1918|Alina: A golden bracelet!? Did you kidnap that girl for something like that? Alina: I have no choice. Let's do something to get the golden bracelet.
0x1919|Bligh: All you have to do is look at fake people a little. It will be a good medicine.
0x191A|Alina: “That girl... I wonder what she’s doing these days.
0x191B|Clift: Even though nothing like this has ever happened in Santheim before... Clift: I'm concerned about their true intentions. Hmm...
0x191C|Alina: I can't forgive you for kidnapping a girl, no matter what the reason!
0x191D|Bly: It's too dangerous for a princess of a country to travel alone... Bly: Once this incident is cleared up, we have to somehow get her back to the castle!
0x191E|Bligh: ``Looks like we got hit by a bee that pretended to be our princess. It was a bit too harsh, though.
0x191F|Clift: ``I'm sure everyone in town is hurting, too.'' Clift: ``We have to do something to help that girl as soon as possible!''
0x1920|Alina: ``That girl...I'm worried.'' Alina: ``If I had been caught, I would have defeated the bad guy and come back right away, but that girl...''
0x1921|Alina: ``How dare you kidnap a girl in front of me?'' Alina: ``I'll definitely find them and hold them until they cry!''
0x1922|Alina: Hey dog... I don't know which dog is this girl's dog.
0x1923|Clift: There's no way a fake princess could match Princess Alina! Of course.
0x1924|Alina: I know it's not about me, but I'm a little angry.
0x1925|Clift: ``What a lame businessman from a humble town!
0x1926|Clift: What is this person saying? Is the princess on the second floor of the inn?
0x1927|Alina: "Maybe there's a fake person for me?...That looks interesting!
0x1928|Bligh: ``Wow, I always thought something like this would happen someday.''
0x1929|Alina: ``This story is getting a little strange.'' Alina: ``Anyway, let's go to the inn!''
0x192A|Bly: Hmm. I have a bad feeling about something.
0x192B|Clift: ``I can't believe that the whole town gathered to see the princess.'' Clift: ``It's amazing how popular the princess is. Wow...''
0x192C|Alina: What do you mean, the princess of Santheim...?
0x192D|Bly: Although it's far away, this town is also part of Santheim. Rumors quickly reach the castle. Bly: Even though we're on a trip, we shouldn't get too far.
0x192E|Bly: Hmph. I guess he's happy that he's not a good guy anyway.
0x192F|Clift: ``Everyone in town is very angry.''
0x1930|I guess you could say they are cheerful people.
0x1931|Alina: ``For now, let's go to the inn. Right?''
0x1932|Alina: “It’s so exciting. It looks interesting!
0x1933|How did you end up giving the golden bracelet to a kidnapper? Hmm...
0x1934|In fact, that bracelet had mysterious magical power.
0x1935|I hope nothing bad happens.
0x1936|The golden bracelet was certainly a treasure of this town.
0x1937|However, due to the existence of the treasure, there was constant fighting, and the treasure was finally sealed away in a cave in the south.
0x1938|Bly: “That villain?
0x1939|. I couldn't see it as a magic user. Then.
0x193A|Bligh: Pulling the strings behind the scenes
0x193B|Does that mean it's out there somewhere?
0x193C|Siya: That guy...hmm.
0x193D|Clift: If the kidnappers knew about the bracelet's magical power... that would be terrifying.
0x193E|Bly: ``The only people who go out at this hour are cats and dogs.Let's go stay at a hotel.''
0x193F|Alina: “It’s time for cats to play now. Me.”
0x1940|Uhito went wild
0x1941|Bly: “That villain?
0x1942|. I couldn't see it as a magic user. Then...
0x1943|Bligh: Pulling the strings behind the scenes
0x1944|Does that mean it's out there somewhere? Hmm. Grumbling...
0x1945|Clift: If the kidnappers knew about the bracelet's magical power... that would be terrifying.
0x1946|Arena
0x1947|Um, don't worry about what's past, right? Overthinking everyone.
0x1948|Alina: The girl was saved, and no matter how much you worry, the golden bracelet won't come back.
0x1949|Bligh: I grumbled, ``I'm forcing this old man to work into the wee hours of the night...''
0x194A|Clift: If I were to take the golden bracelet by myself, I might be able to avoid the worst situation...
0x194B|Clift: No, even if he's a bad guy, he'll keep his promise. If you don't believe him.
0x194C|Alina: If you go outside through this door, you'll find yourself in a graveyard where they'll be waiting for you. We have to keep our heads together.
0x194D|Bri "Princess
0x194E|There are too many people. Because of that fake person who doesn't know what he wants to do... Grumbling.
0x194F|Alina: I removed the seal and brought back the bracelet, but I can't change it for a human life.
0x1950|Bligh: ``How dare you go to a cave at this age? What a damn phony and scoundrel.
0x1951|eye
0x1952|Clift: It is said that the golden bracelet brings misfortune.
0x1953|Clift: ``I hope that some trouble will befall the princess because of the golden bracelet.''
0x1954|Arena: The golden bracelet is in a cave, so let's hurry.
0x1955|Clift: It is said that the golden bracelet brings misfortune.
0x1956|Clift: I didn't know there was one in this town.
0x1957|Alina: “The cave sounds wonderful… I want to go there. Hey, hey.
0x1958|It's scary to kidnap people. What should I do if I get kidnapped too? ?
0x1959|It seems like you saved a princess...no, a fake princess! The whole town is buzzing about that! And aside from that...
0x195A|good morning. It seems like you saved a princess...no, a fake princess! The whole town is buzzing about that!
0x195B|The princess has been kidnapped! ? Oh my God... Orooro...
0x195C|Tohohohoho….
0x195D|As expected of a princess, she has two companions.
0x195E|Welcome to the traveler's inn. I'd like to say that, but the princess is staying overnight today... I'm very sorry.
0x195F|Bligh: ``If she's a princess, who would kidnap such an old woman...I'm confused.''
0x1960|Bligh: ``This time it's a fake, so it's okay...'' What if something like this happens again? Bligh: ``We have to get the princess back to the castle as soon as possible!''
0x1961|Clift: My daughter was saved, and Princess Alina was safe too. God... I thank you.
0x1962|Bligh: You villains. What on earth are you going to use the golden bracelet for? Grumbling...
0x1963|Alina: “Ah! That’s disgusting! I really wanted to beat the bad guy to pieces back then!
0x1964|Alina: ``Mei, you're gone. I wanted to talk to you a little more.''
0x1965|Bligh: ``Looks like we got hit by a bee that pretended to be our princess. It was a bit too harsh, though.
0x1966|Alina: ``It seems like the people at the inn feel a lot of responsibility, too. Even though it's the villains who are at fault!
0x1967|Bligh: ``Looks like we got hit by a bee that pretended to be our princess. It was a bit too harsh, though.
0x1968|Alina: ``It seems like the townspeople are getting pretty anxious too. We need to help them quickly!
0x1969|Bligh: ``The intelligence and elegance that Bligh exudes cannot be imitated by a fake.Bligh: ``Hmm, let's quickly show off that fake face.''
0x196A|Bly: Well then, let's go and see the princess's face.
0x196B|Clift: ``Because of the fake princess, Princess Alina can't stay at the inn!'' Clift: ``We may sleep in the wild, but the princess can't stay like that. Hmm, you fake princess!
0x196C|Alina: ``This inn. There's a fake princess there.'' Alina: ``Is that a good thing? We'll meet that fake princess as mere travelers!
0x196D|I want you all to rescue the princess. If you do, the reward will be as you wish. yeah? What are you looking upset about? That would be rude. I'm the priest of the castle.
0x196E|What happened? Mei... no, the princess has been kidnapped.
0x196F|stop! If you get any closer, the princess will die! But I never expected that a princess would come to this inn! Alright guys, let's go!
0x1970|I don't know who you are, but the princess! Please help the princess!
0x1971|Hmm, I was defeated.... Suddenly, they appear and force the princess...
0x1972|oh! The princess! The princess is being kidnapped! I don't know who you are, but please help the princess!
0x1973|Oh no! Tell me! Someone help me!
0x1974|Bligh: ``Now that the impostor is gone, it's a complete relief! Ah, the atmosphere is so good!''
0x1975|Clift: "That fake group. I hope they're continuing their journey safely..." Clift: "Of course, I don't appreciate deceiving people.
0x1976|Alina: ``There's no one left anymore. Not my fake one, and the other two. It's kind of lonely, isn't it?
0x1977|Bligh: ``This tired old bastard has taken my name!? I have no desire to help you.''
0x1978|Alina: "You'll be able to help Mei soon. In the graveyard at night. Please wait!
0x1979|Bligh: Hmph! The fakers and the villains are all damned!!
0x197A|Clift: "Do I look like someone who can't even help others unless I give them a reward?
0x197B|Bligh: ``This tired old bastard has taken my name!? I have no desire to help you.''
0x197C|Alina: Her name is May. I wonder how she's doing these days. I'm worried...
0x197D|Bligh: It's a blessing in disguise that the one who was kidnapped wasn't the real Princess Alina... Bligh: In any case, we have to punish the villains!
0x197E|Clift: What kind of a bastard are you to kidnap a young girl! I can't forgive you!
0x197F|Alina: “Oh my god… Let’s hurry up and chase after him! Come on, let’s get going!
0x1980|Bly: Wait! The first thing we need to do now is stop those people as soon as possible!
0x1981|Alina: “The bad guy is stealing a girl! We have to save her quickly!”
0x1982|Bligh: Oh my god! The villains were after the princess!
0x1983|Clift: “What on earth is this!?…Ha, those men!?
0x1984|Alina: “The bad guy is stealing a girl! We have to save her quickly!”
0x1985|Oh, I'm tired, I'm tired. The store is already closed today. Please come again tomorrow.
0x1986|If you ever go to Endor, check out the martial arts tournament.
0x1987|I hear there's a martial arts tournament going on in Endor right now.
0x1988|How about some delicious foreign food? Even if your cheeks drop, you won't know!
0x1989|The food I've never seen before looks delicious.
0x198A|Bly: Martial arts tournament in Endor. Huh. That's pretty good. Bly: But I won't be going to Endor. Oh, what a shame, what a shame!
0x198B|Alina: ``I'm sure the participants in the martial arts tournament would like to fight someone even stronger...'' Alina: ``Actually, she's a princess, and she's incredibly strong! For example, a girl like that.'' Alina: ``If your father recovers, he won't forgive you...
0x198C|Clift: ``Princess Arena will definitely win the martial arts tournament!'' Clift: ``And the princess's strength and splendor resonates through Endor as well...Jeez.''
0x198D|Alina: ``I'm sure the participants in the martial arts tournament also want to fight someone stronger...'' Alina: ``Actually, she's a princess, and she's incredibly strong! For example, someone like that.'' Alina: ``...I know. That's not the case right now. Haa.
0x198E|Bly: Martial arts tournament in Endor. Huh. That's pretty good. Bly: But I won't be going to Endor. Oh, what a shame, what a shame!
0x198F|Alina: ``I'm sure the participants in the martial arts tournament also want to fight someone stronger...'' Alina: ``Actually, she's a princess, and she's incredibly strong! For example, someone like that.'' Alina: ``...I know. That's not the case right now. Haa.
0x1990|We are currently discussing where to hold the bazaar next.
0x1991|This is how we travel to various places holding bazaars.
0x1992|Honey of chirping? Ah, there used to be one in this store too. You might still be able to get it if you go to the west tower where the elves are said to come. But unlike in the past, monsters have started living in that tower, so I think it's best to stop.
0x1993|That's bad. It's over for today.
0x1994|Me me.
0x1995|A night with such beautiful stars reminds me of my hometown, which is far away.
0x1996|Grrrr...
0x1997|Meow!
0x1998|Nago.
0x1999|oh! Are you back? How was the king? I'm already worried, worried...
0x199A|a! Princess! How was the king? I'm already worried, worried...
0x199B|Ladies and gentlemen! Please return to the castle immediately! The king is in trouble!
0x199C|a! Princess, I've been looking for you! Please return to the castle immediately! The king is in trouble!
0x199D|Oh no, I bought too many things and it's heavy. It's here. It's here.
0x199E|It's been a long time since we held a bazaar in this desert. After all, I travel all over the world.
0x199F|How about some rare pressure points? Please take a look, even if it's just to look at it.
0x19A0|Rumor has it that there is a shrine to Endor far east from here.
0x19A1|Heheheen.
0x19A2|Desert Bazaar is underway!
0x19A3|Bligh: ``We don't have time to sell oil in a place like this! Hurry up and get the honey of the song!
0x19A4|Clift: The moon that illuminates the desert night sparkles on the water's surface. Sigh...I'm enchanted.
0x19A5|Alina: ``It's a nice moonlit night. The wind feels nice.''
0x19A6|Alina: ``I managed to get the honey of the song! Just a little sightseeing...'' Alina: ``That's what I thought, but there's no bazaar at night. It's a shame.
0x19A7|Bligh: Hmm. The soldiers of Santheim are all excellent!
0x19A8|Clift: I hope the King's condition hasn't worsened...
0x19A9|Alina: ``Thanks to this soldier, you were able to save your father from danger. We need to reward him later.''
0x19AA|Bligh: Hmm. There's a tower to the west of here. There's a nectar of chirping there. Bligh: If that's the case, it's decided. No matter what monsters appear, I'll climb up the tower and get the nectar of chirps in my hands!
0x19AB|Clift: The tower where the elves come. It must be a really tall tower.
0x19AC|Alina: ``What kind of monster is that? Do you think I'm afraid of something like that?'' Alina: ``Let's go to the west tower. And get the honey of the song!''
0x19AD|Bly: Hmm... Let's keep quiet here.
0x19AE|Clift: Please keep the king's illness a secret as much as possible. Clift: That's right! Because we will cure him right away.
0x19AF|Alina: "Should I tell this person the truth? Or...? Alina: No. I can't tell you. I really can't.
0x19B0|Bligh: ``We don't have time to sell oil in a place like this! Hurry up and get the honey of the song!
0x19B1|Clift: "It's so lively! Where did so many people come from in the middle of the desert?" Clift: "But the King... I hope he's safe until we get back to the castle.
0x19B2|Alina: I'm worried about the bazaar, but I'm also worried about my father. Father...
0x19B3|Arena: Where's the song honey? We have to get it quickly and return to the castle!
0x19B4|Clift: “On a starry night, I want to see the face of a princess from my hometown...” No, those are beautiful stars!
0x19B5|Alina: “Father...
0x19B6|Bly: “We don't have time to sell oil in a place like this!
0x19B7|Alina: I'm worried about the bazaar, but I'm also worried about my father. Father...
0x19B8|Bligh: ``This is no good. It's not good at all. Bligh: This is not the time to be traveling carefree. You understand!
0x19B9|Clift: ``The king is the keystone of the country. If something big happens to the king, the country will also be swayed.'' Clift: ``...I have a bad feeling.
0x19BA|Alina: “Father...
0x19BB|Alina: “Is the cat on the castle roof doing well? ...Father.
0x19BC|Clift: The country of Endor and my country, Santheim, have had close ties since ancient times.
0x19BD|Alina: ``Someday, I would like to go to Endor. I would like to go to a dream-like country where a martial arts tournament is held.'' Alina: ``But that's not the time for me right now. Father...
0x19BE|Bligh: This is no time to sell oil in a place like this! It's a big deal for our king!
0x19BF|Clift: "It's so lively! Where did so many people come to gather in the middle of the desert?" Clift: "But the king... Oh, God, please protect the king.
0x19C0|Alina: Could it be that you faked an illness to bring me back to the castle...? Alina: No, that's not true. No, your father must be really troubled.
0x19C1|Alina: I'm worried about the bazaar, but I'm also worried about my father. Father...
0x19C2|Clift: “On a starry night, I want to see the face of a princess from my hometown...” No, those are beautiful stars!
0x19C3|Alina: To me, that star looks like the faces of strong rivals that I'm supposed to meet in the future.
0x19C4|Bligh: Oh, that's a shame. The desert bazaar is over! Let's go home.
0x19C5|Clift: The moon that illuminates the desert night sparkles on the water's surface. Sigh...I'm enchanted.
0x19C6|Alina: ``The desert gets really cool at night.The wind feels nice...''
0x19C7|Alina: "What, aren't the shops open at night? It's boring.
0x19C8|Bligh: Oh! My king!? This is no good. This is no good. Bligh: This is not the time to be traveling carefree. Let's return to the castle at once!
0x19C9|Clift: ``What if it happened to the king?'' Clift: ``Shouldn't we just go back to the castle?''
0x19CA|Alina: “What do you mean, your father is in trouble? I’m curious...
0x19CB|Alina: "When you come to the desert, you'll see a lot of cats. Hehehe, they're so cute!
0x19CC|Bligh: They say that greedy people will eventually go to hell.
0x19CD|Alina: ``I want to buy that much, too! Isn't it okay? Isn't it okay? Alina: Something small is fine. If you have a strong weapon, that's it. Armor is fine. As long as you have a weapon.
0x19CE|Bligh: Don't be fooled. A key point is a key point, even if it's rare. Don't buy things you don't need.
0x19CF|Alina: "A rare pressure point? It looks like a normal pressure point. What's different about it?
0x19D0|Clift: The country of Endor and my country, Santheim, have had close ties since ancient times.
0x19D1|Alina: ``I would like to go to Endor someday. I would like to go to a dream-like country where a martial arts tournament is held.
0x19D2|Bly: ``Huh, it's hot, it's hot. When it's this hot, my head gets light-headed.''
0x19D3|Bligh: Whether it's in the desert or in a town, there's only one thing a businessman thinks about. Bligh: How can he squeeze as much money out of his customers! Don't let him take you for a ride!
0x19D4|Clift: "It's so lively! Where did so many people come from in the middle of the desert?
0x19D5|Alina: ``I'm going to look at all the shops! Isn't that good?
0x19D6|Alina: "I'm here! I'm here! This is the desert bazaar. Wow! Looks interesting!
0x19D7|Grrrrrrrrrrrr.
0x19D8|The sheep is running... The sheep is running... Please don't get in the way! Ah, I don't understand.
0x19D9|Goo goo goo.
0x19DA|Good night....
0x19DB|It looks like he's asleep.
0x19DC|...It's squishy.
0x19DD|Clift: ``Ahaha. That's a smart cat to sleep in an inn.''
0x19DE|Clift: ``Ahaha. That's a smart cat to sleep in an inn.''
0x19DF|Princess, I'm really glad I didn't have to marry a strange man.
0x19E0|You are Princess Arena! ? Please do your best!
0x19E1|The women's chatter is so rambling that I can't follow it.
0x19E2|I just can't like this person named Despisaro. I'm glad I wasn't born a princess!
0x19E3|Despisaro is the winner after all. It's cool...
0x19E4|Be careful of Despisaro!
0x19E5|Princess, I feel sorry for you. If things continue like this, I think I'll be forced to marry someone named Despisaro.
0x19E6|Let me tell you something good.
0x19E7|To enter the castle, you must avoid being seen by the guards.
0x19E8|Good, good. There are so many dishes to wash!
0x19E9|Bly: “Despisaro...Hmm.
0x19EA|Arena: “Despisaro is a wimp at all.
0x19EB|I've never done it before. This person should feel safe now.
0x19EC|Clift: Despicaro really wants to marry the princess, so he uses martial arts.
0x19ED|Did you go to the meeting?
0x19EE|Alina: If marriage is so bad, the Princess of Endor should have just escaped from the castle. Alina: This castle has a moat, so even if she fails to land, she shouldn't get hurt.
0x19EF|Bligh: King Idiot's soldiers seem to be light-headed.
0x19F0|Clift: “The Princess and the Dark...” That’s it.
0x19F1|That’s it! ! It's embarrassing.
0x19F2|Alina: ``If you guys like, you can give me an akushu too, okay? To commemorate the victory.''
0x19F3|Alina: “The winner is me, me! You don’t understand anymore.
0x19F4|Bligh: It looks like someone called Despisarro has put him in serious trouble. But who is Despisarro?
0x19F5|Arena: “Leave it to me! I’ll make Despisaro throw a punch for you too!”
0x19F6|Clift: ``The princess isn't the only thing Despisaro is aiming for.For some reason, I feel like that.''
0x19F7|Alina: If marriage is so bad, the Princess of Endor should just escape from the castle. Alina: This castle has a moat, so even if you fail to land, you won't get hurt.
0x19F8|Alina: “I took the trouble to teach you this.
0x19F9|You must come to the castle!
0x19FA|Bligh: ``Wow, it's so cold. My legs and hips hurt when it gets cold. Let's go back to the ground quickly.''
0x19FB|Clift: ``It's an interesting structure that the prison and kitchen are in the same place.''
0x19FC|Alina: “Well, this place is also part of the castle, right? It’s kind of moldy though.
0x19FD|Bly: ``Despisarro...Despisarro...'' I feel like I heard it somewhere... No, that's... grumbling.
0x19FE|Alina: Despisaro, right? I can't say anything without trying to fight.
0x19FF|Clift: ``Do women value appearance and appearance more than anything else?...Sigh.
0x1A00|Arena: “No matter how cool you are, if you're weak, you can't win. People say weird things.
0x1A01|Bligh: It looks like someone called Despisarro has put him in serious trouble. But who is Despisarro?
0x1A02|Alina: ``After all, everyone judges people by their appearance. I want to show you my strength.''
0x1A03|Bligh: A talkative man doesn't have a good reputation! Another strange thing happened. Bligh: It's no wonder that Santoham's group snuck into the castle and was captured!
0x1A04|Alina: “I took the trouble to teach you this.
0x1A05|You must come to the castle!
0x1A06|Bligh: ``The musty smell in here is unbearable. Let's hurry and get past it!
0x1A07|Clift: ``In the secret underground passageway, there is a prisoner who was once executed...'' Clift: ``Oh, I just imagined it! What should I do?''
0x1A08|Alina: ``That's a very dubious path. It would be fun if there were monsters, but inside a castle. Ahhh.
0x1A09|Bligh: ``The musty smell in here is unbearable. Let's hurry and get past it!
0x1A0A|Alina: ``That's a very dubious path. It would be fun if there were monsters, but inside a castle. Ahhh.
0x1A0B|The martial arts tournament was over, so the Colosseum was closed.
0x1A0C|Ah, Princess Arena! Congratulations on winning.
0x1A0D|Martial arts tournaments are held only during the day. It would be okay to come back tomorrow.
0x1A0E|This is the Colosseum. This is the venue for the martial arts tournament.
0x1A0F|Clift: ``My eyes are still burning. I see the princess's graceful back as she heads toward the center of the Colosseum.'' Clift: ``The sight of the princess fighting in response to the loud cheers...I'm spellbound.''
0x1A10|Alina: ``I wish there was another martial arts tournament.This time, it would be central.'' ``Congratulations are free. You can say as many as you want.''
0x1A11|Clift: ``Hmm, I can't believe there are fans of the princess here too!...I feel really weird.''
0x1A12|Alina: ``I can't believe that everyone knows so much about me.'' Alina: ``With this, I won't be able to jump over walls or attack anyone.
0x1A13|Arena: Hey, can't you hear the cheers in the Coliseum? That voice calling out to me!
0x1A14|Clift: ``If it's this quiet, I think I'll hear some noise.''
0x1A15|Bligh: ``I can't believe we've finally come to the Coliseum...'' Ah, what a thing.
0x1A16|Arena: Hey, can't you hear the cheers from the Colosseum! This feeling makes my heart pound!
0x1A17|The arena is

0x1A20|King: ``What's going on? Hurry up and call Despisaro!

0x1A75|Clift: “Oh princess! Did you notice me!?
0x1A76|Alina woke up on the bed.
0x1A77|Hmm, hmm, that's scary.... Despisaro's strength is so strong that I can't believe it's human... picture? Why am I alive? I guess it was because I was too weak to deal the final blow...
0x1A78|This is a shortcut to get out of the castle. It's convenient when you're in a hurry.
0x1A79|noisy! Don't talk to me! …………. I'm sorry. I'm nervous before the match.

0x1A7C|Alina: “I thought he was like a demon, but Despisaro is also quite kind. It makes me want to fight him all the more!

0x1A84|Beyond this door is Endor's castle. But it's nightfall now. It would be best to come back tomorrow.
0x1A85|Ah, I want to go see the martial arts tournament too.
0x1A86|Beyond this door is Endor's castle.
0x1A87|Bligh: "In any case, I'll go back to Santheim at least once. That's fine.
0x1A88|Alina: ``I want to show this person what I can do in a martial arts tournament.''
0x1A89|Bligh: A princess of her age shouldn't be wandering around in the middle of the night like this!
0x1A8A|Alina: ``I get really excited when I'm told no. Come on, let's go secretly!''
0x1A8B|Bligh: ``Hmm. The stronger the castle's defenses, the stronger the foreign enemies will be. Bligh: Unlike our peaceful country, the countries on this continent seem to be having a lot of trouble.
0x1A8C|Clift: I'm a little reluctant to visit a castle this late at night, but...
0x1A8D|Alina: ``It's a very impressive castle. Even I don't feel like I'm going to give up on the thick walls.
0x1A8E|Bligh: First, we must meet King Endor and greet him. That's the polite thing to do!
0x1A8F|Bligh: ``Everyone, everyone, get excited about martial arts tournaments, martial arts tournaments, and boring things! Bligh: The princess is getting more and more interested in that! It's totally outrageous. She grumbles...''
0x1A90|Alina: ``I want to participate in a martial arts tournament as soon as possible! Hey, it's okay, right? It's okay if I participate.
0x1A91|Bligh: ``Hmm. The stronger the castle's defenses, the stronger the foreign enemies will be. Bligh: Unlike our peaceful country, the countries on this continent seem to be having a lot of trouble.
0x1A92|Clift: ``It's such a splendid castle. King Endor, who lives there, must be a very good king.
0x1A93|Alina: ``It's a very impressive castle. Even I don't feel like I'm going to give up on the thick walls.
0x1A94|Despisaro.... Who the hell was he? He was a mysterious man after all.
0x1A95|Yay! Alina-sama. I was having a good time! It was really cool.
0x1A96|Rumor has it that the monsters stopped appearing around the time Despisaro disappeared.
0x1A97|Wow, it's the real Princess Arena! No, excuse me. Congratulations on winning.
0x1A98|Grrrr...
0x1A99|Exactly how many warriors have been killed by Despisaro...? This is like a princess gathering together strong people.
0x1A9A|I didn't expect him to come into the castle this late at night! Now that I've discovered it, I can't remain silent. Sasa, leave!
0x1A9B|The king here is rash and does what he thinks right away. I'm in trouble.
0x1A9C|The winner of the martial arts tournament can marry the princess here. I feel sorry for the princess too...
0x1A9D|If you want to go to the Colosseum, just go straight down this hallway and go down the stairs.
0x1A9E|If you're going to participate in a martial arts tournament, be careful of a man named Despisaro. It is extremely strong and will not stop fighting until the enemy is extinguished.
0x1A9F|Lately, monsters have started appearing in Endor as well. So the king started holding martial arts tournaments to gather together the strong people...
0x1AA0|The king will sit on top of this.
0x1AA1|A large picture is displayed. It appears to be something that conveys the history of the kingdom.
0x1AA2|Bligh: Thanks to that idiot king, the princess has become smitten again! She grumbles.
0x1AA3|Bligh: Grumbling. A princess doesn't have to be cool, she has to be beautiful.
0x1AA4|Clift: “I totally understand that feeling of wanting to touch someone.
0x1AA5|Alina: “Maybe I’m the type that girls like?
0x1AA6|Bligh: ``When I hear the name Despisaro, I feel something in my heart...It's ominous.
0x1AA7|Arena: In the end, Despisaro was just a weakling. Everyone was thinking too much.
0x1AA8|Bly: ``Despisaro...'' I'm really curious.
0x1AA9|Clift: “Is there some sort of connection between monsters and Despisaro? No, that’s the case. Hmm.
0x1AAA|Alina: ``I wouldn't bite you. You're a small-minded person for a soldier.''
0x1AAB|Bligh: ``But what is it like to win a martial arts tournament? Is it really something I should be happy about?'' Someone who could have been considered a young princess grumbled.
0x1AAC|Clift: ``The faces of everyone in the castle are shining brightly. I'm glad.''
0x1AAD|Alina: ``I heard that the King of Endor is about the same age as your father.'' Alina: ``I heard from the minister before. They used to be friends.
0x1AAE|Alina: ``Once I report to my father, where should I go after that?I feel like I want to cross the ocean...'' Alina: ``Hmm, but the mountains seem interesting too.I'm not sure.
0x1AAF|Clift: What on earth is King Endor thinking about taking a princess instead of a prize? Clift: King Santheim would never commit such tyranny!
0x1AB0|Alina: ``For the sake of the princess, we absolutely have to win! Ah, but...'' Alina: ``If we win, is the tournament over? If we win easily, can't we have fun anymore? Hmm.
0x1AB1|Bligh: ``When I hear the name Despisaro, I feel something in my heart...It's ominous.
0x1AB2|Alina: ``Despizarro is wrong. The match is not about killing each other. Alina: ``I have to teach you that with my deadly punches and kicks.
0x1AB3|Alina: ``The best people are gathering for this martial arts tournament. Ah, my arms are ringing!
0x1AB4|Bligh: ``It seems like the princess who defeated a bear with her bare hands is more interesting than the princess who won the martial arts tournament.'' She grumbled.
0x1AB5|Bligh: ``It seems to be somewhat larger than my castle, but Santheim's construction is more elegant.
0x1AB6|Clift: I hope the princess doesn't get hurt in the martial arts tournament.
0x1AB7|Alina: ``I can't disappoint the expectations of the king and princess. I have to win the martial arts tournament!''
0x1AB8|Alina: ``Let's go to the Colosseum quickly!'' Alina: ``If you're restless, the sun will shine. Come on, hurry!
0x1AB9|Bligh: If this man's words are true, then it seems like someone named Despisaro is quite intelligent. Bligh: Hmm, I guess I should stop the princess after all. Grumbling...
0x1ABA|Alina: ``That's all for Despisaro's world.'' Alina: ``Now that I'm here, I won't let you do whatever you want!''
0x1ABB|Bligh: ``I'd like to just relax at the inn right now.'' Absolutely.
0x1ABC|Bligh: ``Isn't it like a thief walking around in a castle at night? Oh, I'm so sorry.'' He grumbled.
0x1ABD|Clift: ``I don't think Yurei will show up in this castle, right?
0x1ABE|Alina: ``I heard that the King of Endor is about the same age as your father.'' Alina: ``I heard from the minister before. They used to be friends.
0x1ABF|Alina: "Don't make any footsteps, okay? Please talk in a low voice. So that you won't be seen...
0x1AC0|Bligh: It seems like the people have a hard time when someone who isn't a vessel sits on the throne. Hohoho, poor thing.
0x1AC1|Clift: What on earth is King Endor thinking about taking a princess instead of a prize? Clift: King Santheim would never commit such tyranny!
0x1AC2|Alina: “I wonder if the princess here also likes strong people? But what do you mean by “poor”?
0x1AC3|Bligh: ``When I hear the name Despisaro, I feel something in my heart...It's ominous.
0x1AC4|Alina: ``Despizarro is wrong. The match is not about killing each other. Alina: ``I have to teach you that with my deadly punches and kicks.
0x1AC5|Clift: So, will the contestants eventually be hired by Endor as royal guards? Clift: If that's the case, I can't approve of the princess's participation...no, but. Clift: When I imagine the princess mowing down her opponent, I stagger. Ah, what a weak person I am.
0x1AC6|Arena: ``The best people are gathering for this martial arts tournament. Ah, my arms are ringing! I want to fight as soon as possible!
0x1AC7|Bligh: ``It seems to be somewhat larger than my castle, but Santheim's construction is more elegant.
0x1AC8|Bligh: First, we must meet King Endor and greet him. That's the polite thing to do!
0x1AC9|Clift: "Dodo dodo dodo dodo dodo dodo dodo doso, you're a brazen devil. What do you think I'm going to do to meet the king of another country..." Clift: "I guess it's better to wait outside. There's such a thing as social status.
0x1ACA|Alina: ``I heard that the King of Endor is about the same age as your father.'' Alina: ``I heard from the minister before. They used to be friends.
0x1ACB|Alina: The castle in Santheim was cute, but this castle looks strong. Alina: After all, there's something to be said for holding a martial arts tournament!
0x1ACC|Arena: ``It looks like it could be a monster, but nothing comes out. It's boring.''
0x1ACD|How strong Princess Alina is. I'm impressed.
0x1ACE|Despisaro.... That's a really ominous name.
0x1ACF|thank you very much. Now I don't have to go through an unpleasant marriage. But if Alina-sama was a man... Oh, I wonder what I'm talking about. Please listen to me.
0x1AD0|King: ``Well done, Princess Arena, for winning. I sincerely thank you!'' King: ``If you let him know about this, I'm sure your father, King Santheim, will be very happy.'' King: ``For now, you should go back to your country and show us how you're doing.
0x1AD1|King: ``Hmm! I'm sure your father, King Santheim, will be very happy if you let him know about this.King: ``For now, you should go back to your country and show us how you're doing.''
0x1AD2|I would also like to thank you. Dear Alina. Thank you very much.
0x1AD3|King: “Princess Arena, well done for winning. I sincerely thank you!
0x1AD4|Despisaro...that's an ominous name.
0x1AD5|The king and princess are already on vacation.
0x1AD6|Because Father has made a promise to you, I must marry the winner. But if the winner were a woman, I wouldn't have to force myself into a marriage. Please. Please come to the martial arts tournament! Princess Arena. I envy you for living freely.
0x1AD7|Because Father has made a promise to you, I must marry the winner. Ah... what will become of me?
0x1AD8|King: So, what happened to Princess Alina?
0x1AD9|King: ``Then I have a favor to ask of you, by all means, win the martial arts tournament!'' King: ``Actually, I regret it too. Princess Alina, please!
0x1ADA|King: ``Oh, good to see you here! I've already heard about you from King Santheim.'' King: ``I'm really impressed by your journey, where you're so worried about the fate of the world!
0x1ADB|Despisaro.... I feel like I've heard the name somewhere, but I can't remember it...
0x1ADC|Indeed, my king has made an incredible promise. Please listen to what the princess has to say.
0x1ADD|This is King Endor's room.
0x1ADE|There is a book called ``The Wonderful Colosseum.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Our Colosseum in Endor was built by the current king. It is popular among the people for its martial arts tournaments and various other events planned by the king. Bloody, meaty, dancing battle! A play full of dreams and romance! All entertainment is at the Colosseum!
0x1ADF|There is a book called ``Secret Exchange Diary.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Cute Monica. I thought of you 50 times today. The centerpiece of your breakfast, the pillars of the castle, the cat in the garden, the fish in the pond, and the grass on the roof all look like your face. The world is full of Monica! Good luck Monica! As always, I'll send this diary to Endor via a secret route. with love
0x1AE0|Clift: ``When the princess is praised, she's happy and her face lights up with a smile.'' I have to do my best.
0x1AE1|Alina: ``From now on, I have to continue training and become even stronger! It's important for people to have a desire to improve.
0x1AE2|Bligh: ``Despisarro...'' His scheme won't end there. Bligh: ``I have a feeling like that.
0x1AE3|Alina: I'm sure Despisaro got scared of my strength and ran away. Alina: I'm strong. I heard you're strong, but you're not just a timid person. Ah, I had high hopes for you when I sang.
0x1AE4|Clift: "There's a rival in a place like this...!
0x1AE5|Alina: “Am I really that cool? It kind of makes me laugh.
0x1AE6|Bligh: ``It's the stupid king's shirinugui,'' but the victory itself is an auspicious one. Princess. You did a great job.
0x1AE7|Clift: “This is how the name of the princess spreads from Endor to the rest of the world.
0x1AE8|Alina: “Winner, I’m so happy to have won. Hehehe, I wonder what your father will look like if he finds out!”
0x1AE9|Bly: Hmm. But, the princess was saved too, so I guess I should say I'm glad. Bly: Anyway, Despisaro. What on earth did he do...?
0x1AEA|Clift: ``The princess's lovely appearance. Ah... it was wonderful. I have no more memories of her.
0x1AEB|Alina: ``I knew from the beginning that I would win, but I'm really happy!'' Alina: ``Let's tell the father of our country!
0x1AEC|Bligh: Idiot... No, it's terrible that a princess is in trouble because of a careless king. Bligh: In a situation like this, it would be humane to help her.
0x1AED|Clift: If it's Princess Alina, I'm sure she'll marry the one who wins. Clift:...There's too little hope.
0x1AEE|Alina: ``Freedom is just the beginning, though. I don't mind the details.'' Alina: ``As a fellow princess, I really want to help you.''
0x1AEF|Bligh: That idiot... no, what's going on because of that thoughtless king? He grumbled.
0x1AF0|Clift: ``Princess, aside from Lord Bligh, I, a mere priest, can't believe I'm passing by the king of another country...'' Clift: ``Maybe it's better to wait outside. There's such a thing as social status.
0x1AF1|Alina: ``That princess is probably around the same age as me. She seems quite shy though.
0x1AF2|Alina: ``I heard that the King of Endor is about the same age as your father.'' Alina: ``I heard from the minister before. They used to be friends.
0x1AF3|Bligh: ``Isn't it like a thief walking around in a castle at night? Oh, I'm so sorry.'' He grumbled.
0x1AF4|Clift: Isn't it better to say Nakokokokokokokokokunko?
0x1AF5|Alina: Looks like it's time for the king to take a break. Alina: Come to think of it, your father had an early night as well. How are you, father?
0x1AF6|Bligh: ``Please feel free to ask! If something were to happen to my princess, what would you do?'' she grumbled.
0x1AF7|Clift: ``The princess is truly trusted by the king of another country...I'm touched. I'll support you!''
0x1AF8|Alina: ``King, I can't turn down your impending wish.'' Alina: ``Anyway, I just have to win the martial arts tournament, right? It's not easy.
0x1AF9|Bligh: Idiot... No, it's terrible that a princess is in trouble because of a careless king. Bligh: In a situation like this, it would be humane to help her.
0x1AFA|Clift: If it's Princess Alina, I'm sure she'll marry the one who wins. Clift:...There's too little hope.
0x1AFB|Alina: ``Freedom is just the beginning, though. I don't mind the details.'' Alina: ``As a fellow princess, I really want to help you. You can participate in the martial arts tournament, right?
0x1AFC|Bligh: Our princess is more important now than someone else's. We have to go to church quickly.
0x1AFD|Clift: "How pitiful. If Princess Alina is doing well, I wish she could have grown up!
0x1AFE|Clift: ``It's called Despisaro. I feel like there's something deceptive about it.''
0x1AFF|Bly: Yes, a normal princess would sit on the throne like that and be unreliable. Bly: And yet, my princess. Oh, that's so pitiful. She grumbles.
0x1B00|Alina: In this country, fathers are giving their daughters trouble. It's just the opposite of me.
0x1B01|Bligh: First, we must meet King Endor and greet him. That's the polite thing to do!
0x1B02|Clift: ``Princess, aside from Lord Bligh, I, a mere priest, can't believe I'm passing by the king of another country...'' Clift: ``Maybe it's better to wait outside. There's such a thing as social status.

0x1B09|Clift: ``The princess was truly magnificent.Ah, I cry when I think about it.''
0x1B0A|Alina: ``I have to quickly tell my father about our victory. Let's go back to Santheim!
0x1B0B|Bligh: It seems that there are some hard-working servants of Endor as well.
0x1B0C|Alina: “It reminds me of a bed in a castle. Ah, fluffy feather comforters!
0x1B0D|I thank God that I was able to get through this day safely. Amen.
0x1B0E|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x1B0F|Clift: God, please protect Princess Alina and Santoheim...
0x1B10|Despisaro disappeared, and the monsters also stopped appearing... Is there any relationship between these two?
0x1B11|My daughter has been looking at the sky a lot lately. What on earth happened...?
0x1B12|Good night....
0x1B13|Are you guys going to the martial arts tournament too? But I think... king
0x1B14|But there seems to be a reason why it gathers such strong people.
0x1B15|Among the books that seemed to be difficult, there was only one book written as ``Aim to become a Momo man! Beginner's edition''...
0x1B16|Bly "Death
0x1B17|And the monster... I hope it's just my old man's imagination. Hmm.
0x1B18|Bligh: ``In that case, you should just bring your daughter back into the house.'' You're just talking about it, aren't you? You grumble.
0x1B19|Alina: ``I hope you don't get upset just because you look at the sky or because you're a tomboy.''
0x1B1A|Bly: Hmm. There's a reason... I have to meet the king more and more. Come on, let's go to the castle!
0x1B1B|Alina: ``I don't care. As long as I can get away with it as much as I want in the martial arts tournament, that's enough.''
0x1B1C|Onya, strong princess! Good day.
0x1B1D|Well, are you the winner? So what was the prize? picture? Don't get anything? But why did you try so hard? You also like things...
0x1B1E|The old man in this house is a strange person, always looking at the sky.
0x1B1F|Our ancestors have always been rich. Ohhohohoho.
0x1B20|It is a relief with elaborate workmanship.
0x1B21|It is decorated with expensive-looking armor.
0x1B22|Alina: ``I hope you don't get upset just because you look at the sky or because you're a tomboy.''

0x1E8C|This is King Batland's room.
0x1E8D|The king here is truly a fine man. I can't believe he even remembers the names of each of his subordinates... Hey Ryan.
0x1E8E|Pray at church and you will have a record of your journey. Visit the churches wherever you go. Then pray to the gods and have them record your deeds in your adventure book.
0x1E8F|King: ``Ryan, good to see you back! King: ``Huh...'' Looks like I can understand something about that confident look on your face. King: ``Hmm... Flying shoes? I see, I see...'' King: ``In any case, bring the children back to their mothers as soon as possible.'' King: ``I'm looking forward to your success. Ryan.
0x1E90|King: "Welcome back, Ryan! However, it doesn't seem like much progress has been made yet." King: "In any case, we need to find out the cause of the children's spiriting away as soon as possible." King: "We look forward to your success. This is a golden dragon statue that protects the Prince of Wales.
0x1E91|Carved with the coat of arms of the Butland royal family.
0x1E92|Hui Min: I'm sure the king relies on Ryan the most out of all the warriors in the royal palace.
0x1E93|Hui Min: ``I think it's rude. I'm not human yet. Is it okay for me to come to the throne room?''
0x1E94|Hui Min: ``Wow, there's a king. I wonder if he'll call out to me too.''
0x1E95|Ha………. What a dream it was...
0x1E96|Nuo~! It's out! You monsters!
0x1E97|Lately, when I look at the sky, I can't help but feel empty. I hope nothing happens...
0x1E98|The king is anxiously waiting for some good news.
0x1E99|That's a shame, Ryan!
0x1E9A|Would you like to report to the king? However, unless it is an urgent report, I would like you to do it tomorrow. Since the king is busy during the day, I want him to take a good rest at night.
0x1E9B|You can enter the castle, but you can't meet the king. It's the night's routine.
0x1E9C|Who do you think it is, Ryan? Please pass by.
0x1E9D|Leave the defense of the castle to us, and Ryan-san, please do your best to explore the child!
0x1E9E|Hui Min: “The king goes to bed early.
0x1E9F|Hui Min: “This is Butland Castle...
0x1EA0|Huimin: Mr. Ryan's mission is to find the missing child.
0x1EA1|Yay Yay! You can play quietly starting tomorrow!
0x1EA2|Good night....
0x1EA3|Hmmm. I feel like I need to pee... But it's scary to go alone.
0x1EA4|Is it true that the child will disappear? But I'm not a child anymore, so it's okay.
0x1EA5|It seems the incident has been resolved. As a parent with a child, I can now live with peace of mind.
0x1EA6|I have already closed the store today. If you want anything, please come back tomorrow.
0x1EA7|Even monsters can't get into the town, so they shouldn't be able to kidnap children. But then how do the children disappear? It's creepy...
0x1EA8|Oh? Are you shopping? If so, please go outside the store and talk to me behind the counter.
0x1EA9|Aleks: “What a warrior! It’s me. It’s Aleks. Thank you for your help!
0x1EAA|Flare: It's thanks to the warriors that my husband came back like this... Thank you very much.
0x1EAB|Flare: "What? My husband, Aleks, committed theft and ended up in a prison in the village of Imru..." Flare: "Oh my god. I can't believe that Aleks would commit theft." Flare: "Please, warrior! Please take me to my husband!
0x1EAC|I'm Flare. Her husband, Aleks, went on a trip and never returned. But my husband will definitely come back. Alex is someone I can't live without. But, warrior, if you see my husband Aleks on your travels, please let me know.
0x1EAD|How long are you willing to wait? You should just give up and remarry me...
0x1EAE|Child: ``Hey, it's Alex-chan. But he's acting a little weird. He looks like an adult.
0x1EAF|Flare: I'm really bothered by my husband's absence.
0x1EB0|Thank you very much for exterminating the demons. Now I can live in peace.
0x1EB1|If I were a little younger, I could have fought alongside you... That's a shame.
0x1EB2|Hahaha, it's my job! You are really nice people!
0x1EB3|Ryan! You did it! By the way, I have a favor to ask of you... I decided that I was the one who rescued the children, so with all my supplies, the castle-crowned-scary came back, and the children were rescued safely, too, and the warrior-sama is really reliable.
0x1EB4|oh! It was you. Solving the Imuru incident
0x1EB5|He was a rumored warrior.
0x1EB6|Kisha!
0x1EB7|picture? Do you have any idea about the incident where the child disappeared? ? You're an idiot, too. A monster kidnapped that thing.
0x1EB8|It's waiting, isn't it?
0x1EB9|...Ugh. I want to be able to sleep in a house that protects me from the rain as soon as possible.
0x1EBA|It seems that the wife of this house has been waiting for her husband to return home for a long time. Poor Nou...
0x1EBB|Flare's husband, Aleks, is a big fan of her. Apparently he went looking for clues to get to the tower surrounded by a lake.
0x1EBC|Flare: "What? My husband, Aleks, has committed theft and is in a prison in the village of Imru..." Flare: "Oh my god. I can't believe that Aleks is stealing. Flare: Please, warrior! Please take me back to my husband.
0x1EBD|Tonayo
0x1EBE|Stop it!
0x1EBF|I'm Flare. Her husband, Aleks, went on a trip and never returned. Warrior! If you see my husband Aleks while traveling, please let me know.
0x1EC0|If you are in the village of Imuru, you can reach it by passing through the cave to the west of the castle and walking northeast.
0x1EC1|King Batland keeps taxes low so as not to burden the people. However, it seems like they can't spend much money on weapons and armor for their soldiers. If you want more powerful weapons and armor, you can save up your money and buy new ones. and……. Don't forget to re-equip after buying new weapons and armor!
0x1EC2|This is the castle town of Butland.
0x1EC3|As expected. No, I'm sorry I had to go out of my way.
0x1EC4|Hahaha...I'm out of breath... After all, it's hard for the elderly. Please go without worrying.
0x1EC5|Oh Makoto! ? Let's follow along! By the way, I don't like combat.
0x1EC6|. Rekuya. It won't be of any use to you, so don't think so.
0x1EC7|When I was young, I also admired being a warrior in the royal palace. This old man wants to help the warrior-sama who protects Batland. What do you think? Won't you take me with you?
0x1EC8|Child: ``You're amazing, uncle. Everyone appreciates you. Child: ``When I grow up, I think I'll become a warrior in the castle. Maybe then they'll appreciate me.''
0x1EC9|Hui Min: “Ryan is in Batland. Everyone thinks so.
0x1ECA|Hui Min: ``Even if it's just a joke, it's too brazen of you to ask me to give you my hand.''
0x1ECB|Child: ``Uncle, is Imuru here yet? I'm hungry.
0x1ECC|Child: ``Daddy, aren't you angry? We broke our promise and played outside the village, so this happened...''
0x1ECD|Child: ``I want to meet mom and dad quickly.
0x1ECE|Child: “Uncle, what should I do? I feel like I need to pee. Pee, pee!
0x1ECF|Hui Min: “Now that you have fulfilled your mission, Mr. Ryan is going back to work at the castle.”
0x1ED0|Huimin: ``I'm thinking of continuing my journey to become a human being. If you don't mind, Mr. Ryan...'' Huimin: ``No, I don't think so.
0x1ED1|Hoi Min: ``Mr. La Ryan... Neronoma!... is here. It's better not to get too excited.''
0x1ED2|Hui Min: ``That doesn't seem like much. To humans, we monsters are evil from the beginning.
0x1ED3|Flare: He's the only one who truly cares about me and Aleks.
0x1ED4|Flare: While I'm doing this, my husband is locked up in a dark, small prison, and he's having a hard time.
0x1ED5|Flare: If we keep walking through the night, we'll reach Imuru by morning. Let's hurry, warrior.
0x1ED6|Flare: I still can't believe it. There must be something wrong with my husband stealing.
0x1ED7|Huimin: “Mumnyamnya… I don’t want to sleep yet.
0x1ED8|Hui Min: Even in the castle town, it's so quiet at night that you can hear the insects.
0x1ED9|Hui Min: “Oh, that’s it… It seems like everything is in danger.
0x1EDA|Hui Min: “As expected of Mr. Ryan!
0x1EDB|Hui Min: There's no way Ryan-san would forget to equip his weapons and armor, right?
0x1EDC|Flare: ``That old man has always been young at heart.'' Flare: ``It seems like he was disappointed that he was rejected, but it can't be helped.
0x1EDD|Hui Min: ``That's kind of you, Mr. Ryan. I guess you declined the offer out of concern for your grandfather's safety.
0x1EDE|Hui Min: Goodbye, old man. Aw, I can't believe we're breaking up right after we met...
0x1EDF|Flare: ``You're such a kind person.'' Flare: ``But I don't think I'll be able to keep up with you on my old legs.
0x1EE0|Hui Min: “From today on, you're one of our friends too. I have to introduce myself now.
0x1EE1|Flare: ``Oh, I'm so dizzy... I can't even imagine what it would be like for my husband to be in prison.
0x1EE2|Hui Min: ``Hmm...I think he looked nervous when he saw me. I guess he's scared of me after all.''
0x1EE3|Flare: While I'm doing this, my husband is locked up in a dark, small prison, and he's having a hard time.
0x1EE4|Flare: If you want to go to Imuru, you can walk, but if you hurry, you'll be there by night.Now, let's set out, warrior.
0x1EE5|Flare: I still can't believe it. There must be something wrong with my husband stealing.
0x1EE6|Hui Min: ``It's nice to be human. I want to become a human soon too.''
0x1EE7|Huiming: “I wonder if the townspeople will be surprised when they see me.
0x1EE8|Hui Min: ``Wow, there are so many people there. I'm getting dizzy.''
0x1EE9|Hmm. Does a monster have power? It's a sign that something bad is happening somewhere...
0x1EEA|Lately, I feel like monsters have been gaining power over me.
0x1EEB|What about Ryan? Did you know? There is something called military history behind the strategy... If you look at it, you'll automatically know how you fight.
0x1EEC|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x1EED|It's an old but well-maintained organ. It must have been important for many years.
0x1EEE|The rumors have arrived. You exterminated the monster that ate children, right? Huh? Maybe it's a little different.
0x1EEF|Grrrr...
0x1EF0|A kidnapped child. If you go to the village of Imuru, you might learn something. After all, spirited away children are happening in Imuru. In that case, we should go to Imuru first.
0x1EF1|Flare: My husband also went missing around the time that children started disappearing. Flare: It might have something to do with the incident.
0x1EF2|picture? Have you already helped the children? What's up!
0x1EF3|what? Are you going to take me to the exit? Thanks for your help, Ryan. I'll show up on my own!
0x1EF4|It's confusing.... It seems like he got lost...
0x1EF5|Oh Ryan! Thank you very much. Just call it where you go.
0x1EF6|Hui Min: ``Pupupuu'' Looks like this warrior was lost here for a long time until Mr. Ryan rescued the child.
0x1EF7|Flare: "Stealing bread and getting caught is unbecoming of a husband. What exactly happened?
0x1EF8|Hoiming: ``Since I'm a slime, I like humid places. Hoiming: On the other hand, dry places with strong sunlight are bitter. If you stay there for a long time, you'll get cold.
0x1EF9|Hui Min: ``It's a humid cave. Maybe it's because there's a river flowing above it.''
0x1EFA|Hui Min: ``Ryan-san said he would show you around, so it would be rude of you to turn him down.
0x1EFB|Hui Min: ``It's a terrible direction to get lost in a place like this.''
0x1EFC|Hoi-min: ``I'm jealous that you have friends next door.'' Hoi-min: ``I lost my friend a long time ago, so I've been alone ever since.
0x1EFD|North from here is Komis Village.
0x1EFE|The bridge belongs to everyone. Let's not break it.
0x1EFF|East of here is the village of Tempe.
0x1F00|Do not mess around in the forest.
0x1F01|If you find someone suspicious, go to the castle! King Butland
0x1F02|Oh warrior! My son is gone too! What on earth did this person do? ? What good is there in kidnapping a child?
0x1F03|There is a household account book for this family. When you look inside, you can feel the awful way of life.
0x1F04|Flare: My husband and I will eventually have children... Flare: It's hard to believe that it's someone else's problem when our children disappear...
0x1F05|Huimin: ``There were people who would do terrible things like kidnap children.
0x1F06|My brother and Pupur disobeyed their father's orders and got hit with a drumstick. Even though my dad told me I shouldn't play outside the village...
0x1F07|There is no record of Battlera being taken away by a man in prison.
0x1F08|A prison, a prison, a warrior.

0x1F12|Thank you for helping my brother.
0x1F13|You are a true warrior! I wish you all the best in your future endeavors!
0x1F14|Oh Ryan! I completely changed who you are! I'm sure the king would be happy too.
0x1F15|Ah, it was worth waiting for, believing that he was definitely alive. Have you forgotten? I wish I could go to Butland's castle. I am your mother at that time.
0x1F16|Yay Yay!
0x1F17|Oh really! My sons almost became prey to monsters... Anyway, thank you for helping my child!
0x1F18|How can I say thank you? Thank you very much.
0x1F19|Mom! It's this person. This person helped me. Hey uncle.
0x1F1A|{7f44}Oh, it's mom! yay! yay!
0x1F1B|Gubigubi puhah. Drinking alcohol while looking at the stars is the best.
0x1F1C|By the way, when the guy who stole the bread was caught, he asked all the kids about it.
0x1F1D|The uncle in the dungeon is apparently named Aleks. We are good friends.
0x1F1E|Hmm, I don't understand.... In my eyes I see a child
0x1F1F|I wonder if it's even possible...
0x1F20|The uncle in the underground prison was said to have lived in Butland.
0x1F21|What's outrageous is that at night, someone peeking through the safro always appears. I'm so jealous. If only I could run away faster...
0x1F22|We have not yet received any information about the child's whereabouts... I think the tower to the west of this place is suspicious, but how can I get there?
0x1F23|Isn't it a little like Ryan? ? You have finally arrived at the village of Imuru! We have not yet received any information about the child's whereabouts... I think the tower to the west of this place is suspicious, but how can I get there?
0x1F24|Oh warrior! My son is gone too! What on earth did this person do? ? What good is there in kidnapping a child?
0x1F25|This is school. The missing Sappur was also a student here.
0x1F26|Thank you for coming, warrior. Search for a child like this
0x1F27|death
0x1F28|. Demon. I guess it's okay though... That girl caught my eye
0x1F29|He disappeared so I could see him.
0x1F2A|Yay, warrior! Welcome to the village of Imuru.
0x1F2B|Hui Min: “That mother was crying. I guess it was tears of joy.
0x1F2C|Hui Min “The brave man”
0x1F2D|I wonder. The monsters may be targeting children all over the world for some reason.
0x1F2E|Hui Min: “Hey, Ryan.
0x1F2F|When I slur, my face turns red. Surprisingly, he's a telly shop.
0x1F30|Hui Min: ``I'm going to continue my journey to become a human. If you don't mind, Ryan...'' Hui Min: ``No, it's nothing.
0x1F31|Hui Min: I'm still a monster, so I can't live in a castle...
0x1F32|Hui Min: ``The case is now resolved. I wonder if Mr. Ryan will return to the castle after all.''
0x1F33|Hui Min: “Look, look, Mr. Ryan! Both the mother and the child are overjoyed.
0x1F34|Hui Min: ``When I looked at this old man, I thought of my friend Be Hui Min, who only drank a lot.'' Hui Min: ``By the way, Be Hoi Min was good at drinking beer.
0x1F35|Hui Min: Hee hee hee hee. That warrior has a long face, so if I were to compare him to an animal, he would be a horse.
0x1F36|Flare: Where is the dungeon? Come on, warrior, please lead me to my husband.
0x1F37|Hoiming: ``There are some people who become more energetic at night.If anything, I'm a night owl slime.'' Hoiming: ``That's why I don't want to sleep yet, so I'm exhausted.
0x1F38|Hui Min: ``It's quiet. I wonder if everyone went home?''
0x1F39|Flair: ``Soon, my husband and I will have children...'' Flare: ``Children...
0x1F3A|I can't believe that it's someone else's problem...
0x1F3B|Huimin: ``There were people who would do terrible things like kidnap children.
0x1F3C|Flare: “The child
0x1F3D|I wonder if there is some connection between the incident and her husband going missing...?
0x1F3E|Hui Min: “This person is
0x1F3F|My husband and child are gone... Aww, I feel sorry for her.
0x1F40|Flare: You've finally come to Imuru. Now, warrior-sama, please guide me to my husband.
0x1F41|Hoimin: Ryan-san, Ryan-san. The weather is so nice today, so let's bask in the sun.
0x1F42|Huiming: ``Wow, there are so many people here. But I'm a little worried.'' Huiming: ``But if you're with Ryan, you'll be fine!
0x1F43|This is cheap
0x1F44|Give the children a walking stick. You're so strong!
0x1F45|Hey, hey, is it true that something from hell will come back to life? That's not true.
0x1F46|Okay, I'm big too.

0x1FDD|yay! Thank you uncle! We can go home. Ah, that's right. Apparently, if you jump off the top of this tower, you can get out.
0x1FDE|I can't believe it's as broken as a human... But I'm sure other monsters will find the hero and put an end to him... You humans will eventually become sacrifices to the Emperor. I'll be waiting for you in hell...ugh!
0x1FDF|Our focus is only on children. Only children with the potential to become heroes! There's no use in riddles for adults. But now that they know this place, I can't let them go home alive. Let me die, warrior!
0x1FE0|{7f45}Hmph, that must be a lot of trouble! I guess that means I've finally found this place... But I can't give my child back.
0x1FE1|{7f44}Uncle, help me! These guys bully me, thinking I'm a hero.

0x1FF0|Child: ``Hey! Yay! I guess I can go home. I can see mom and dad.
0x1FF1|Huiming: ``The only way to save the children is to fight these guys.''
0x1FF2|Hui Min: “You can’t run away.
0x1FF3|Hui Min: “Ryan-san. These guys look really strong. I wonder if we can win...”
0x1FF4|It seems that somewhere in the world, the Emperor of Hell is making a comeback. However, according to the monsters' prophecies, the hero who will destroy the Emperor is also growing. So the hero, while still a child, has not yet gained any power, finds it, and heads into the darkness, bravely, bravely, bravely, bravely, bravely, bravely, bravely. Ryan! Please protect the children...!
0x1FF5|There is no response even if I talk to him. It seems like he has already taken his last breath. Ryan remembered his friend's words.
0x1FF6|La Ryan...? I can't do it anymore. Listen carefully... It seems that somewhere in the world, the Emperor of Hell is making a comeback. However, according to the monsters' prophecies, the hero who will destroy the Emperor is also growing. There, a hero finds it while it is still a child, and turns it into darkness. That is the goal of the monsters. Ryan! Please protect the children...!

0x2019|Oh, it's Ryan! ? I too found that old well and came all the way here.
0x201A|The door was exposed. Debono. Well, if this was the case, I would have recruited a monster called Huiming that was in the old well... Hey, that person behind you is Hui Min! I'm totally jealous of you.

0x20A8|Bligh: I just hope that the golden bracelet doesn't fall into the hands of demons. Hmm. That's troublesome.
0x20A9|Alina: I knew about the power of the golden bracelet. But I couldn't change it into a human life. Alina: But... but what if the bracelet was back then... No, there's no point in thinking about it.
0x20AA|Torneko: ``Even if you get it, you should probably refrain from giving it to Nene as a present...''
0x20AB|welcome. Unfortunately, there is only one room available, but you can relax.
0x20AC|Clift: ``The inn here is always busy. I wonder what kind of people are staying there.
0x20AD|Torneko: "Ah, what a waste! This first floor! As soon as we put in a shop, we can put in a bed. Torneko Torneko, Torneko Torneko Torneko Torneko Torneko Matoruneko Rudo Tekotsuregotto. We'll think carefully about cost performance!

0x222D|Orin: Oh! Edgan, Master! Good job, stay safe! Orin: It's me, Orrin! I nearly died in King Leo's castle. Orin: Is that okay, Master? Orin: The old Balzac is protecting a man named Despisaro... Orrin: Huh? The two of you have already defeated Balzac? Is that true!? Orin: What...! Is that so? Father, that Balzac... Orin: You've become a great man. Now, all the Edgans in heaven can rest in peace. Ugh...
0x222E|Orin: "Oh! Edgan, Master! Good luck! Stay safe! Orin: It's me, Orrin! I almost died in King Leo's castle. Orin: Are you okay, Master? Orin: It seems that the old Balzac is under the protection of a person named Despisaro. Orin: Despissaro plans to use the secrets of evolution to make the monsters even more powerful. Orin: Before that happens, we must release the secret of evolution to the darkness! Orin: I'm sure the late Edgans are wishing for that!
0x222F|I'm Orin. He was a disciple of the great alchemist Edgan. I wonder what Edgan's brothers are doing these days...
0x2230|I was trying to escape from King Leo's castle when I found Lord Orin. He was injured so badly that at first I thought he was dead. But when the soldiers chased after me, Orrin-sama suddenly stood up and grabbed me... Orrin is a lifesaver. Pop...
0x2231|Ryan: ``I'm so jealous that I've been being cared for by that woman ever since!''
0x2232|Alina: ``You're such a strange woman. It's a shame that I can help her.''
0x2233|Torneko: "That's good. It's youthful. It's a drama. I wish I was a little younger too!
0x2234|Manya: Hey, Orin does a great job too! He looks pretty good on you.
0x2235|Ryan: ``That guy named Olin. He's injured, but he seems to be doing pretty well.
0x2236|Clift: The demons that were tormenting King Leo are gone. However, there's still a lot of trouble in the world. Clift: Now, let's continue our journey.
0x2237|Minea: ``I never expected to meet Orin-san in a place like this. But I'm glad.'' Minea: ``I wanted to show Orin-san the defeat of Balzac.
0x2238|Manya: "It's really Orin! I'm glad...I'm glad. I'm glad he's alive..." Manya: "I've defeated Balzac, too, so your father can feel at ease. Hehe, I'm so happy.
0x2239|Ryan: ``That guy named Orrin. He's injured, but he seems to be doing pretty well.
0x223A|Bly: What are the villains trying to do using the secret of evolution? Hmm. Bly: Hmm. Well, that's fine. In any case, the monsters are destined to be destroyed by us!
0x223B|Alina: I'm sure Balzac is a big fan of Manya and Minea. That guy and Despisaro? Alina: Then we'll have to defeat both Despisaro and Balzac!
0x223C|Minea: ``I can't believe you did that. But I'm glad.'' Minea: ``I won't let you fall in love with Balzac any more. I'll make sure to punish you!''
0x223D|Manya: "It's really Orlin! I'm glad...I'm glad. I'm glad he's alive..." Manya: "Balzac...and he's still alive too. Wash your neck and wait!
0x223E|Ryan: Edgan? Hmm. That's a name I've heard somewhere. Is that... Komiz village?
0x223F|Clift: It looks like that person is looking for Manya and Minea. Clift: Wouldn't he be very happy if we could meet him?
0x2240|Torneko: Isn't Edgan-san the name of Manya-san and the others' father?

0x2404|I wanted to show Mr. Orin how to defeat the secret Balzac.
0x2405|Manya: “It’s really Orin.
0x2406|hey! It's good, it's bittersweet
0x2407|I'm glad you're alive Nurse Manya: ``I defeated Balzac, too, so your father can rest easy.''

0x241D|hey
0x241E|Wash your neck and wait!
0x241F|Ryan: “Edgan?
0x2420|It's a name I heard somewhere, Kublain. Is it Komiz Village?
0x2421|Clift: “It seems like the other side is Manya-san and others.”

0x242B|It's a name
0x242C|Wow
0x242D|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x242E|Panon: ``...Hmm!? I feel the same soul in that priest as I do!'' Panon: ``Hmm, why?
0x242F|Alina: Now that I think about it, the village priest's puns were pretty lame.
0x2430|Grrrr...
0x2431|Torneko: ``Huh? Ah, I'm getting sleepy too. Shall we go to the inn now?''
0x2432|Minea: Did you know? If you sleep with the north as your pillow, you'll be more likely to fall in love with gold.
0x2433|Good night....
0x2434|Not long ago, there was a monster in this village... But once upon a time, a cute cat came and defeated the monster. Oh no, how strong that man is! With that, I don't think you'll be able to get a wife. Wahahaha.
0x2435|Oh, I'm sure you are...! Thank you for saving the village.
0x2436|There is a book that says, ``Let's travel to the wonders of the world!'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. There are many wonders waiting for us in the world. A gigantic statue of a god, a tree that touches the sky, a kingdom hidden behind a rocky mountain, and many towns that cannot be found on any map. You can see for yourself whether my words are true or not. Traveling is good! Let's go on a journey! The world is waiting for you!
0x2437|Minea: No...that's it. Alina-san, she often gets half-asleep and kicks me and my sister away. Bligh:...Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.
0x2438|Bly: ``The princess is quiet and cute only when she's sleeping.
0x2439|Torneko: ``That's so cute. The child's sleeping face really looks like an angel!''
0x243A|Susuuu….
0x243B|Hmm... I can't sleep tonight. How true is the rumor that the Emperor of Hell will rise again?
0x243C|I have to work hard for the sake of my unborn child! Okay, I'll do my best!
0x243D|Nina: We've had a baby. Nina: Now this village will be a little more lively. Huh.
0x243E|I feel like the monsters that have been coming out of the village have gotten even stronger lately. They say monsters have settled in the castle of Santheim, so I'm worried...
0x243F|My daughter Nina had a baby. Until that child grows up, we must protect the peace of the village at all costs!
0x2440|Alina: “Oh, really? Hey, it was just a little mistake!
0x2441|Bri: "Princess! The dragon god is not our enemy!
0x2442|Arena: “Whether it's the Emperor of Hell or the God of Dragons, I'll defeat them all!
0x2443|Clift: ``For someone who is the Emperor of Hell, he must be a formidable enemy.'' Clift: ``God, please give me strength. Please protect the princess and her friends.''
0x2444|Minea: If the rumors about the Emperor of Hell are true, we are the only ones who can stop them. Minea: We must do our best for everyone in this village.
0x2445|Bly: It seems like that stupid idiot has become a little more willing to work properly. Hmm.
0x2446|Torneko: "Oh yeah! Me too, I was so happy when Popolo was born! Torneko: "I knew from the bottom of my heart that I had to do my best from now on. You see.
0x2447|Alina: Nina-san, the baby was born! Hurray! I was surprised.
0x2448|Manya: If it were me, wouldn't you? I'd like to marry someone rich, beautiful, strong, and kind. Manya: Everything was out of the question, but I can't stand Torneko.
0x2449|Clift: The people of Tempe have been tormented by monsters for a long time. Clift: That's why their fear of monsters is stronger than in other villages. Let's put them at ease as soon as possible.
0x244A|Arena: Rumors about Santheim have reached Tempe... Arena: But right now, we have to do what we can first. There's no point in rushing.
0x244B|Manya: Monsters are scary if you're not used to fighting like we are. Manya: If we don't eradicate them as soon as possible, it's no good.
0x244C|Ryan: ``What a fun village chief. I'm sure the village will be safe.
0x244D|Alina: ``For the sake of Nina-san's baby, let's defeat the monsters quickly.''
0x244E|Torneko: "That's right. When I think about Poporo's future, I have to work hard now. Torneko: I'm feeling motivated too!
0x244F|As I gaze at the pond, many memories come flooding back to my mind. Nostalgic people, nostalgic smiles, but memories won't come back.
0x2450|Aoru gold gold and gold gold good gold.
0x2451|Not long ago, there was a monster in this village... But once upon a time, a cute cat came and defeated the monster.
0x2452|Yeah. Oh no, how strong that man is! With that, there is no way I can get a wife.
0x2453|I guess so. Wahahaha.
0x2454|Oh, I'm sure you are...! Thank you for saving the village.
0x2455|I have to work hard for the sake of my unborn child! Okay, I'll do my best!
0x2456|Nina: We've had a baby. Nina: Now this village will be a little more lively. Huh.
0x2457|This is the village of Tempe. a! It's the older sister who defeated the monster back then! Yay, Yay, I'm glad to see you again!
0x2458|This is the village of Tempe.
0x2459|This is Tempe, a village deep in the mountains. Now everyone is living a peaceful life.
0x245A|An Idomaneki appeared from inside the well! !
0x245B|<NAME> peered into the well.
0x245C|To the girls who died for the village Written by Yonpo Ryan! That's what was carved on the tomb.
0x245D|``The reason I look back on the past is because I'm old. Me? I still have a long way to go!
0x245E|``I'm so busy trying to protect the princess every day that I don't have time to reminisce.
0x245F|Alina: “…Your father is still a memory.
0x2460|It's not. I'm sure it's still alive. Alina: As long as you're still alive, I'm sure we'll meet again. We can live together again...
0x2461|Minea: What a sad profile. What on earth happened to that person...?
0x2462|Manya: “You can make as many memories as you want from now on.”
0x2463|Isn't it? Manya: “That's why I try not to think about it too much.
0x2464|Panon: The village of Tempe is called Tempe because it's located at the top of a mountain! Panon: I guess it's not good today.
0x2465|Ryan: ``If I didn't have a good time, I would have worked so hard.It seems like a peaceful village.''
0x2466|``For now, let's rest at the inn for today!
0x2467|Clift: If you think about it, it's like your journey with the princess started from this village.
0x2468|Alina: "...Father.
0x2469|Torneko: ``I'm sure it must be exhausting to transport goods up this high mountain.'' Torneko: ``Well, I respect you.
0x246A|Minea: "...Oh? In this village. It seems like a lot of girls died. Minea: "But...it seems like they've all successfully attained Buddhahood. Hehehe.
0x246B|Manya: ``I quite like this rural village.'' Manya: ``When I see a beautiful girl, my beauty becomes even more intense.''
0x246C|Oh my gosh. Before I bow down to the face of the princess's child.
0x246D|Yes, I think I'm going to go to the grave.
0x246E|Clift: ``The princess back then was so strong and cool. Look, Ryan. Isamu.'' Clift: ``Oh, just remembering it makes me so happy! Saru: The legend of Ma and Miko's debt, or the story of Alina-san's heroism. I wonder which one is more amazing.''
0x246F|Alina: “Hey everyone. I get embarrassed when I get praised so much.”
0x2470|Isn't it!
0x2471|``It seems like that stupid idiot has become a little more willing to work properly. Hmm.
0x2472|Torneko: "Oh yeah! Me too, I was so happy when Popolo was born! Torneko: "I knew from the bottom of my heart that I had to do my best from now on. You see.
0x2473|Alina: Nina-san, the baby was born! Hurray! I was surprised.
0x2474|Manya: If it were me, what would you say? I don't have any money, but I'd like to marry a kind man with a nice face. Manya: I can't do everything, but at least I can't give up my face and money.
0x2475|Ryan: ``I like children. I often played with them at Imuru and Butland.
0x2476|Clift: ``Right now, even if it's just a thank you, I feel for that child.'' I said, ``Even though I'm a child, I can't look down on you. Yeah! I won't lose!''
0x2477|Alina: "Hehe, he's so big. He's so sad.
0x2478|Torneko: ``It seems like Alina-san is rampaging through the country. She's quite a celebrity!
0x2479|Clift: "Anyway, this grave. If I had known about it earlier, I could have saved it...
0x247A|Alina: ``When I first came to Tempe, I was still a pretty princess.
0x247B|Panon: The village of Tempe is called Tempe because it's located at the top of a mountain! Panon: I guess it's not good today.
0x247C|Ryan: ``It's always nice to see children in good spirits.''
0x247D|“Hmm. It doesn’t seem to have changed. Pretty much!
0x247E|Clift: If you think about it, it's like your journey with the princess started from this village.
0x247F|Alina: ``Good! It seems like everyone in Tempe is living a happy life. Alina: ``It's so nostalgic. Back then, even your father was still...well, it's nothing!''
0x2480|Torneko: ``I'm sure it must be exhausting to transport goods up this high mountain.'' Torneko: ``Well, I respect you.
0x2481|Minea: ``Oh? In this village. It seems like a lot of girls died. Minea: But what's wrong with that? It seems like they've all successfully attained Buddhahood.
0x2482|Manya: ``I quite like this rural village.'' Manya: ``When I see a beautiful girl, my beauty becomes even more intense.''
0x2483|Girls who once sacrificed themselves for the village died here. I sing these songs so that my daughters' souls may rest in peace.
0x2484|I am offering a song of prayer here so that the world may be at peace.
0x2485|Clift: ``Prayer is important. However, peace may not come just by praying.'' Clift: ``Recently, I've been thinking that...
0x2486|Arena: If the monster from that time came out now, I'd knock it out with just one finger!
0x2487|Minea: ``Ah, I can see them. They're all happily dancing to the poet's song.''
0x2488|Clift: ``Prayer is important. However, peace may not come just by praying.'' Clift: ``Recently, I've been thinking that...
0x2489|Arena: If the monster from that time came out now, I'd knock it out with just one finger!

0x2788|Would you like to tell this person about Medal King's Castle?
0x2789|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x278A|Good night....
0x278B|Hi! Isn't that a Torneko? You've become better. Rumors that you bought a ship have even reached this village. That's a big deal!
0x278C|I heard a rumor that an old friend of mine named Torneko had bought a ship. He used to be used by people a while ago, but he's gotten a lot of promotion. I'm glad to know you, but I feel a little lonely since you seem to be far away.
0x278D|Hey, do you need something? If you're from my house, the shop is open during the day, so come by at night.
0x278E|Torneko: "Is this what you mean when you say you're not allowed to make a living in your hometown? No, that's embarrassing.
0x278F|Hi! Isn't that a Torneko? You've become better. Rumors that you bought a ship have even reached this village. That's a big deal!
0x2790|I'm busy at work right now. If you have something to do, leave it later.
0x2791|Torneko: "Is this what you mean when you say you're not allowed to make a living in your hometown? No, that's embarrassing.
0x2792|Minea: ``Even though there aren't any customers...'' My fortune-telling says this store is long.
0x2793|Manya: “What?! I can’t help it if it makes you feel bad. Hmm!
0x2794|Hey Torneko! It's me, Tom's son! Your wife gave me this house. I'll become a great merchant like you!
0x2795|I am a servant of God, but I fell in love with this person... Pop...
0x2796|There is a child's doodle book. Every page is filled with cute animal pictures.
0x2797|Torneko: "That's Nene... My wife does some pretty cool things too. Torneko: As expected, she's too good for me.
0x2798|Bligh: Newly married families have a unique sense of shame.
0x2799|Alina: I wonder if that person's name is Tom's son? Alina: There are some people in this world with strange names.........Sho......Ryan, it's quite a bit...Ryan: That young man might become a big name in the future.
0x279A|Manya: “Ah, ah. I wonder if a good man who can love me that much will ever appear in front of me.
0x279B|Clift: God blesses those who love each other, even if they are in God's service. Clift: Someday, I'll be with the person I love... No! I'm talking to myself right now!
0x279C|Alina: ``I can't just say such harsh things just because I am a servant of God.'' Alina: ``I wish Clift had a softer mind like that.''
0x279D|Tom: “Kokkuri, kokkuri….
0x279E|Even Old Tom's son has gotten ahead of me... Ah, I should get married soon too!
0x279F|Oh, it's a Torneko! It's been a while. By the way, how is Nene doing? I'm just curious as to why such a beautiful woman would marry someone like you.
0x27A0|Oh? It's rare to be a traveler. You must be very curious to come all the way to such an empty town.
0x27A1|Apparently there is a merchant from this town who has achieved great success. I think the name is Tabby Cat... is that right? Was it ash?
0x27A2|Wan wan wan!
0x27A3|Wan wan wan!
0x27A4|Wan wan wan!
0x27A5|Welcome to the town of Lake Nava! Huh? What is it, Torneko? It was a waste of time to say welcome.
0x27A6|Welcome to the town of Lake Nava!
0x27A7|Tom: Where are you taking me?
0x27A8|Tom: ``Oh! Torneko! I really can't thank you enough...'' Tom: ``My son works very hard and even got married. I'm looking forward to seeing his grandson's face.''
0x27A9|Tom: ``Thanks to someone, my son started working seriously.''
0x27AA|Hi! Isn't that Mr. Torneko? You've become better. It looked completely different.
0x27AB|Please do not remove the flowers from the flower pods.
0x27AC|Minea: "According to my fortune telling, that person will be single for the rest of his life... I feel sorry for him.
0x27AD|Manya: ``I don't know...'' Manya: ``Marriage, marriage is a bond, so women won't approach you, right?
0x27AE|Toruneko: ``He's my childhood friend, but for some reason he doesn't have any relationships with women...'' Toruneko: ``He may have a bad mouth, but at heart he's a good guy. Why isn't he popular...?
0x27AF|Ryan: ``I'm single too, but that's because I'm devoting my life to my mission. Ryan: Even so, when I was in Batland, I was very popular with women. Ryan: ``Oh! I don't believe in that chaos! It's not a lie!''
0x27B0|Torneko: “I’m neither a cat nor a plant!”
0x27B1|Manya: I'm sure your wife was looking for the torne cat's belly! Manya: The torne cat's belly jigs when you touch it, and it looks like it feels good.
0x27B2|Toruneko: Actually, I don't even know why my wife married me. Toruneko: She's really good-natured and has a good heart, too much for me... Toruneko: Well, I guess I've gotten a little carried away. I apologize for that.
0x27B3|Ryan: ``I'm jealous that Torunekodo has a beautiful wife.'' Ryan: ``What, when the world became peaceful, I and I...''
0x27B4|Minea: “Dog... I wonder if Pesta from Komiz Village is doing well these days?”
0x27B5|Torneko: ``I'm friends with that Thomas, who used to kill foxes with me.'' Torneko: ``It seems like he remembers my chaos. Don't say anything and use your power. Please tell me something.'' Bligh: ``It doesn't sound like a joke when a princess says it!''
0x27B6|Alina: ``I was planning on using my strength to get through, but I'm glad you moved away.'' Alina: ``This is also thanks to Toruneko!
0x27B7|Ryan: ``He's a very clever dog. It's amazing that he remembers the cries of the Torneko!''
0x27B8|Manya: “Did you introduce Toruneko to that old man’s son as your girlfriend?
0x27B9|Torneko: "No way. I get so angry when I receive such gratitude. Torneko: "What? All I did was give that man's son a chimera wing.
0x27BA|Hoffman: ``Thanks to all of you, I was able to get back on my feet.'' Hoffman: ``It's wonderful to be able to do something for others!
0x27BB|Minea: “Then, could you please make your sister work more seriously?”
0x27BC|Manya: "Hmm. There are some people out there who would rehabilitate someone else's son.
0x27BD|Panon: ``Lake Nava is a very beautiful place.'' Panon: ``Hmm, I guess Ku is getting in the way.
0x27BE|Hoffman: Is this the birthplace of the great merchant Torneko? Hoffman: I too would like to be called a great merchant someday.
0x27BF|Minea: My fortune-telling says there are no new discoveries to be made in this town. Minea: Wouldn't it be better to head somewhere else?
0x27C0|Manya: ``It's kind of a shitty town. I'd rather go to the casino than come to a place like this.''
0x27C1|Torneko: ``This Lake Nava is my hometown. Torneko: I feel nostalgic for the days when I was standing at the counter as a clerk at a weapon store.
0x27C2|Bly: ``It's a pretty nice town. I want to live in a place like this when I retire.'' Bly: ``However, at this point, I don't know when I'll be able to retire...I grumble.
0x27C3|Alina: ``During the martial arts tournament in Endor, the bridge was destroyed, so we couldn't come here.Alina: When did that bridge get repaired?
0x27C4|Clift: Now that I think about it, there's a cave near this town that contains a treasure called the Iron Vault...
0x27C5|Ryan: ``What kind of business do you have in such a remote town? Ryan: ``Huh? This is Torneko's hometown! Sorry for the inconvenience.

0x2AC9|fault? Mr. Torneko! Old Tom is really grateful to you. Of course it's me too... Pop...
0x2ACA|Please join me in praying to God for world peace.
0x2ACB|Minea: Toruneko-san, don't get me wrong... Minea: That person doesn't really like you, that's for sure.
0x2ACC|Manya: Why does that person make Kao blush? Manya: I can't believe that Torneko... No way! Isn't there a reason for that?
0x2ACD|Torneko: "Huh? Why would Sister thank me?
0x2ACE|Clift: Doing good deeds is also in line with God's teachings. Clift: Isn't that what you mean when you say that sister is grateful?
0x2ACF|Bligh: Hohohoho. It really hit home for me! Did you understand who the hero was?
0x2AD0|I heard that there is a shop in the land of Endor that sells powerful armor... When I went there before, I couldn't find a store like that. I was completely fooled.
0x2AD1|Grrrr...
0x2AD2|somewhat! Mr. Torneko! Actually, I also went to Endor... I lost money at the casino... After all, it's best to work steadily. Hohoho....
0x2AD3|There is a book called ``True Horror Stories.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Of a journey. I got lost in the forest and wandered into a strange village. The villagers are all kind and hospitable to strangers, even offering to let them stay overnight. The merchant, who was in trouble, gratefully accepted the offer and decided to stay in the village that day. And the next morning... When I woke up, it was just a wasteland. It is said that the village disappeared without a trace.
0x2AD4|Manya: ``I don't know of a shop like that.'' Manya: ``The only thing I know about Endor is the casino.
0x2AD5|Torneko: Come to think of it, there was a building in Endor that was locked and couldn't be entered. Torneko: By any chance, you mean that one?
0x2AD6|Bligh: Hmm. This is just as he said, false information. Bligh: I've been to Endor before, but I've never seen a store like that. Bligh: It's really not that big of a deal in Endor.
0x2AD7|Clift: ``In a country as big as Endor, it's hard to find just one store.'' Clift: ``No, I'm afraid.
0x2AD8|Minea: ``That person looks like my sister. Minea: I hope he never goes astray again...''
0x2AD9|Manya: ``I understand how people are feeling right now.'' Manya: ``But no matter how much you regret it, whenever you get money, you just end up spending it on the casino again.
0x2ADA|Ryan: ``Everyone makes mistakes.'' Ryan: ``There's still something to be seen in that person who reflected on it and changed his mind.''
0x2ADB|Grrrr...
0x2ADC|picture? What? He's on a journey in search of a legendary sword! ? Why don't you stop saying such strange things and calm down.
0x2ADD|I see! Well, good luck! You have a cute wife.
0x2ADE|Yo! Isn't that a Torneko? What do you think? Is Endor's store profitable?
0x2ADF|Do you need something? You don't look like a businessman, but... If you're here to buy weapons, please go to the store above.
0x2AE0|Torneko: ``No matter how long it takes, I won't be impressed by the master.''
0x2AE1|!
0x2AE2|Right? It's me! It's me! Old Tom's breath
0x2AE3|Yes. In the rainbow direction, Ryan is trying to work seriously.
0x2AE4|Work? I got it from my parents.
0x2AE5|Hoffman: ``Once this journey is over, I'll call myself a businessman somewhere.''
0x2AE6|. Tahi's ``Ryan breath''. Ugano... I want my sister to follow my example. Huh...
0x2AE7|``Before I released him from the prison at Castle Bonmaur, I was wondering if it was really okay...
0x2AE8|``It seems my actions were not wrong. No, I'm glad. I'm glad.
0x2AE9|Arena: “That old Tom’s breath.

0x2E2D|Ryan: ``It's a cave with some strange mechanisms.Ryan: If I were to go by myself, I wouldn't be able to go far.''
0x2E2E|Bligh: I can't believe you're talking to me in a place like this. The hero is a talkative person.
0x2E2F|Minea: It seems like this cave's mechanism is to prevent those who enter from going deeper. Minea: Is there something really important? I hope it's not a waste of effort.
0x2E30|Manya: "I don't like it. If I walk through a cave like this, I'll end up covered in mud!
0x2E31|Torneko: ``So there's a rumored iron safe deep inside this cave.'' Torneko: ``...But even if I get it now...
0x2E32|That's what it feels like.
0x2E33|Clift: It seems like this cave was built by humans to protect something important.
0x2E34|Alina: Ah, already! I don't like caves full of tricks like this! Alina: I get irritated when I'm in places like this.
0x2E35|Ryan: ``It's a cave with some strange mechanisms.Ryan: If I were to go by myself, I wouldn't be able to go far.''
0x2E36|Bligh: ``I don't think there's any reason why you would have to crawl into a cave like this. Bligh: I won't say anything bad. What kind of hero are you? Let's just get out of a place like this as soon as possible!''
0x2E37|Minea: ``It looks like this cave's mechanism is to prevent those who enter from going deeper. Minea: ``But now it's useless, and I'm scared of climbing in.''
0x2E38|Manya: ``I don't like it. If I go to a cave like this, I'll end up covered in mud!''
0x2E39|Torneko: Since we've already taken the iron safe, there's not much point in staying here. Torneko: Now, go somewhere.
0x2E3A|. Let's take care of the money!
0x2E3B|Clift: This cave is to protect the iron vault.
0x2E3C|It looks like it was made by hand. Clift: Well, now it's a waste...
0x2E3D|Arena “Ah
0x2E3E|Dive! I don't like caves full of tricks like this! Alina: ``I get irritated when I'm in a place like this.''
0x2E3F|Ryan: ``What a strange and unusual cave filled with Minea.'' Ryan: ``If I were to go by myself, I wouldn't be able to go far.''
0x2E40|Bligh: ``The hero really likes you so much that you're talking to me even in a place like this.''
0x2E41|Minea: ``It looks like this cave's mechanism is to prevent those who have entered it from going deeper. Minea: Is there really anything that important? The innermost part of the cave is said to be ``I don't like it.'' If we go into a cave like this, we'll end up covered in mud!
0x2E42|Torneko: "There's a rumored iron safe in the back of this cave. Torneko: ...But even if we get it, it feels like it's too late.
0x2E43|Clift: What is this cave?
0x2E44|To protect my current work
0x2E45|It looks like it was made by hand.
0x2E46|Arena “Ah
0x2E47|Dive! I don't like caves full of tricks like this! Alina: ``I get irritated when I'm in a place like this.''

0x2E4A|Naha
0x2E4B|Let's say it is!
0x2E4C|Behoman “Behoman Behoman.
0x2E4D|Thank you, thank you. I was attacked by a monster and seriously injured, but this person's technique saved me!
0x2E4E|She looks a little strange, but she's an old woman who can save people's lives without having to pay for it. It will become a big thing someday!
0x2E4F|I wonder where the priest went this late at night... Since the priest is not there, there are people who don't know what's going on in the church...I'm in trouble.
0x2E50|God lives in a castle in the sky, and I'm sure he's always watching over us.
0x2E51|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x2E52|Lucia: ``That's cute. There are some good monsters in this world.
0x2E53|Manya: "Don't talk to me! If you get angry, you'll be forced to join the Behoman religion!
0x2E54|Bly: "That's a suspicious guy. He looks like a monster. Or rather, he's a monster himself!
0x2E55|Ryan: ``It doesn't seem like it's doing any harm, so we don't have to exterminate that monster right now.''
0x2E56|Minea: ``I didn't see that person's injury heal directly, so I can't trust whether it's true or not.''
0x2E57|Manya: This person is definitely Sakura! She's trying to gather Behoman believers by performing miracles.
0x2E58|Clift: ``He's such a kind person that he heals his injuries without asking for money.'' Clift: ``No, he looks a little strange to be called a human, though...''
0x2E59|Wow, it's definitely going to perish! Ugh. Hiccup….
0x2E5A|You're a nice person. Ugh. Hiccup….
0x2E5B|Hey, please tell me! The world isn't going to end! ? Even if it's a lie, just say yes!
0x2E5C|No matter how much we pray to God, the Emperor of Hell will destroy the world... Is this what you can do without drinking? Hiccup….
0x2E5D|I guess the customers these days are curious.
0x2E5E|Welcome! But the bar only opens at night. Sorry.
0x2E5F|Bly: Good morning, can you stop crying! Yes, since you young man started crying in public.
0x2E60|Manya: ``I'm not crying because you're an adult.''
0x2E61|It's so ugly.
0x2E62|Toruneko: I didn't answer seriously, but I honestly didn't expect you to cry so much.
0x2E63|Ryan: No matter what happens, let's protect world peace!
0x2E64|Manya: ``I can't help but shed tears with these comforting words.
0x2E65|Alina: As long as we're here, the world won't perish!
0x2E66|Torneko: ``If we don't do something about the Emperor of Hell quickly, the number of drunkards may increase all over the world.''
0x2E67|Minea: Even if you run away to drink, the Emperor of Hell won't disappear, so don't you think it's a waste of time?
0x2E68|Bligh: It's so foolish to indulge in alcohol to forget the terror of the Emperor of Hell!
0x2E69|Ryan: At this rate, it's only a matter of time before rumors of the Emperor of Hell spread throughout the world.
0x2E6A|Ryan: ``Staying now is a waste of time. Let's come back in the evening.''
0x2E6B|Minea: ``Ah, that's good, that's good.'' Minea: ``If the bar had been open during the day, my sister wouldn't have tried to move from here.
0x2E6C|Manya: ``Oh no! I can't see you. Is it possible that you came all the way to do it at night?
0x2E6D|Doing business on a raft makes me feel hungry. Don't eat food yet! Meshi ha! ?
0x2E6E|My family's gluttony also really bothered me.
0x2E6F|I have to prepare what I want to eat by the time my family gets home.
0x2E70|It's called a castle in the sky, so there's a castle above the clouds, right? I wonder if such a thing is possible...
0x2E71|Gugo Gugo.
0x2E72|Because of the King's blessings, it looks like the city will become as crowded with comedians as Montbarbara.
0x2E73|That's a lot. I just sing. I sing.
0x2E74|Please don't get in the way of other people's dates.
0x2E75|La la la, your face reflected on the surface of the water!
0x2E76|Here in Stansiara, there has been a legend about a castle in the sky since ancient times... For more details, please ask the scholar in the castle. It's just a legend. It's a long time ago. It's too bad that we forgot it.
0x2E77|Please don't talk to me. I'm a night owl.
0x2E78|The person who makes me laugh from the bottom of my heart will receive the best reward! This is the king's message. Can you make the king laugh?
0x2E79|You came here with the intention of challenging the king's blessings! ? You can't enter this castle without a raft. Good luck!
0x2E7A|Welcome to Stansiara, the city of water.
0x2E7B|At the weapon shop! Business begins after the sun sets. I'll work hard all year round.
0x2E7C|Torneko: If there's a castle above the clouds, then that means there are people living above the clouds.
0x2E7D|Bly: Build a castle on the clouds!? There is no one but God who can do such a feat.
0x2E7E|Clift: ``You can't build a house or even stand up and walk on top of the clouds!''
0x2E7F|Manya: I can't believe there's a castle above the clouds. It's definitely a superstition.
0x2E80|Ryan: A long time ago, I heard a story from King Butland about the castle in the sky, but I've completely forgotten about it. Ryan: At that time, I didn't really listen to the story because it was something that would never be relevant to me.
0x2E81|Bligh: They say that people become forgetful as they get older, but I'm fine with that. Bligh: I remember exactly what I had for breakfast.
0x2E82|Clift: It might be a good idea to live in Montbarbara for singing and dancing, and Stanciala for comedy.
0x2E83|Torneko: If the number of comedians continues to increase, I wonder if a theater will be built in Stanciara.
0x2E84|Manya: That person is wrong! Montbarbara is not a town of comedians, but a town of song and dance!
0x2E85|If you sing a song to a woman, will she be happy?
0x2E86|Bligh: When I was younger, whenever I met a girl, I would always hide from others. Bligh: But today's young people would flirt with me during the day! It's really disrespectful.
0x2E87|Manya: ``I'd be a little jealous of people who suddenly start singing during a date.
0x2E88|Alina: "Do you sing on dates? I've never heard of it.
0x2E89|Bligh: It's truly the end of the world to see such nice young people lying around during the day and not working!
0x2E8A|Manya: “We should just open the store during the day, so why do we go out of our way to open it at night?
0x2E8B|Torneko: ``Closing the store during the day and opening it at night...that's a new way of doing business.
0x2E8C|Torneko: One thing I've learned is that no matter how hard we try, the king won't laugh.
0x2E8D|Clift: ``It's surprisingly difficult to make people laugh. Now, what are we going to do now?''
0x2E8E|Ryan: ``I'm sorry, but we can't make the King laugh.'' Ryan: ``The only way to make him laugh is with the help of a comedian. If only someone like him existed.
0x2E8F|Panon: ``Everyone is riding on the raft. How comfortable is the raft?'' Panon: ``I'm sure the king here will laugh out loud at this.
0x2E90|Manya: ``They're all very skillful, right? But sometimes some people might fall off the raft into the water.''
0x2E91|Minea: ``It seems like a hassle. I have to get on a raft every time I move...''
0x2E92|Torneko: ``That's unusual. People here get around on rafts.''
0x2E93|Bligh: ``If possible, I don't want to get on the raft. Bligh: If I fall off the raft, I won't be able to pull myself up, so I might drown.''
0x2E94|Alina: ``It would be faster to travel by boat than to get on a raft. I would definitely do that.
0x2E95|Ryan: Is this the castle town of Stansiara, famous as the Water City?

0x31A7|I'm keeping watch to make sure no monsters enter this castle. Monsters have become smarter than in the past, so we can't let our guard down.
0x31A8|Torneko: The king must have made such a gesture because the princess wanted to see people's smiles.
0x31A9|Bligh: The princess of this country is a very kind person, never forgetting about her people.
0x31AA|Manya: If something funny happens, I'll always laugh from the bottom of my heart. Even if I'm feeling down.

0x31E5|This steel sword has no teeth! What do you think? Isn't it interesting?
0x31E6|After the demon Bli appeared, the feelings of the people of this country went dark. That's why the king made such a statement, knowing that he would be laughed at.
0x31E7|Alina: ``I'm in so much pain right now that I didn't want to make a pun.It's kind of sad...''
0x31E8|Torneko: ``Uppupupu. Isn't it a dog?

0x31F1|Bligh: Although he's younger than me, Panon is someone I look up to a lot!
0x31F2|Panon: Yes, I can make the king laugh. I'm very confident.
0x31F3|Minea: I'll use the tarot to divine Panon's whereabouts. Minea begins fortune telling... Minea: Hmm, I'm not feeling well today.
0x31F4|It seems too.

0x31F6|It should be.

0x31F9|Manya: Even if we go alone, we won't be able to make the king laugh, will we? Manya: We should definitely ask Panon here!
0x31FA|Alina: If you've come this far, you'll have no choice but to believe in Panon's power.

0x320F|There is a praying teacher between the tree and the cow! This made the king laugh. That was fun. I'll think about the next one.
0x3210|The story is a secret until it is announced in front of the king. It would be a big deal if it was stolen.
0x3211|If you can make the king laugh, you can get any reward you want! Good luck!
0x3212|Manya: The reason why he made such a gesture was because the king wanted to laugh as hard as he could.
0x3213|Bligh: If he made that comment just because he wanted to laugh, then I wouldn't like the king of this country.
0x3214|Ryan: ``The king has his own thoughts. He shouldn't criticize what the inferiors do.''
0x3215|Torneko: I guess the king is trying to bring peace to the world in a different way than us.
0x3216|Alina: My father is a fine man, but the king of this country is just as fine.
0x3217|Bligh: A king who keeps making strange gestures for his people. The people of this country are happy people.
0x3218|Ryan: The king is determined to be a laughing stock and will continue to make jokes to make people smile.Ryan:Then, let's do our best to remove people's anxiety and fear!
0x3219|Panon: ``Between the tree and the cow, the prayer master! That girl is amazing! She's a genius! I would love to have her as my disciple.''
0x321A|Manya: I'm going to ask you, Panon. Everyone's expectations are based on your lips.
0x321B|Ryan: ``I think we're going to laugh out loud in front of the king when we hear Panon's gag.''
0x321C|Clift: Hmm, what kind of tricks will Mr. Panon do to make King Stansiara laugh?
0x321D|Panon: ``It's okay. I'm sure I'll show you the king's heart-warming smile.''

0x358D|It is said that the sands of time have a mysterious power that can turn back time just a little bit. If there was something like that, even if I lost my life in battle, I might be able to save my life...

0x358F|This is a nameless village forgotten by the flow of time. By the way, do you guys know the legend of the sands of time?

0x3591|Alina: "It's crazy to turn back time while we're fighting!
0x3592|Kakakakakakakakaka? I'm sure you'll be able to make a lot of money someday if you use it. Manya: But since the legend of the man who made a fortune in the sands of time doesn't survive, I guess it can't be used in a casino.

0x3601|Non, it's full.
0x3602|Bau Bau!
0x3603|A long time ago, there used to be a stone in this village called a water stone. When it was sunk in a pond, it instantly dried up the water in the pond.
0x3604|This is the grave of our ancestors who were pirates. Like those who died at sea, this grave will also sink into the sea at night.
0x3605|Oops, I'm at work right now. If you want to talk, come over tonight!
0x3606|Our ancestors were pirates, but at some point they abandoned their ships and went ashore. The treasures I have collected are hidden deep inside a waterfall somewhere in the world... Rumor has it that among the treasures was the ultimate sword, a stray metal sword.
0x3607|This is a seaside village!
0x3608|This is a boat used for fishing.
0x3609|It is written that a brave Viking family rests here.
0x360A|Torneko: ``.........'' Torneko: ``Ah, I'm sorry. It's just out of my habit that I don't use the dry stone. I don't care if I jump around and pick up the dry stone, I want someone to remember that I picked up the dry stone. Manya: ``I'm no good. I'm really forgetful.''
0x360B|Minea: “For just a moment, when I picked up the dry stone, a waterfall came to mind.
0x360C|Bligh: If you sneak into the women's bath and dry up the water with a dry stone, I'm sure Onago will be surprised.
0x360D|Ryan: Now, where and how should I use this precious stone?
0x360E|Manya: What will happen if we use water stones in the sea or lake? Will some parts of them become small and dry up?
0x360F|Minea: If you drop something into a pond, if you have a dry stone, you can pick it up without getting wet.
0x3610|Clift: I just can't imagine it. What use would a stone that dries up a pond have?
0x3611|Ryan: If you dry up the water in the pond with a drying stone, you'll be able to catch the fish in the pond.
0x3612|Torneko: ``Don't make small talk behind the scenes while he's standing at the counter. He's a fine merchant.
0x3613|Clift: ``I have no choice. I don't want to get in the way of work, so I'll just wait until night.''
0x3614|Alina: ``I'm not in the middle of dealing with customers, so it would be nice if you could at least talk to me.''
0x3615|Bligh: Speaking of tombs, the tombs of the Santheim royal family will be destroyed by our ancestors if we don't start repairing them soon.
0x3616|Manya: ``I wish we didn't have to go to the trouble of building graves where things would sink into the sea.
0x3617|Clift: I'm a selfless priest, so I have no interest in pirate treasure.
0x3618|Manya: Even though our ancestors were pirates, the people here live a very simple and quiet life.
0x3619|Ryan: ``The Stray Metal Sword. It is said to be a famous sword that every warrior would want to own at least once.
0x361A|Torneko: "If you travel with <HERO>, you'll find gold and silver treasure someday. Oops. Excuse me. Torneko: The purpose of our trip was to prevent the resurrection of the Emperor of Hell.
0x361B|Lucia: ``I'd like to go into the sea.'' Lucia: ``I wonder if sea water is really salty, just like it says in the book I read in Castle in the Sky.''
0x361C|Manya: No, it's a bit cold for me because the wind is strong.
0x361D|Torneko: ``The wind is so strong...aah! Torneko: I got sand in my eyes.
0x361E|Clift: ``Ah, when I look at the ocean, I remember how I almost drowned when I was a child, and I feel depressed...''
0x361F|Ryan: ``It wouldn't be a bad idea to live as a fisherman in a village like this after you retire.
0x3620|Clift: “H-Princess sunbathing! Just imagining that...Bhaaah!
0x3621|Alina: ``Here I can swim and sunbathe every day, so I don't get tired.
0x3622|On days when the sea is rough, the sound of the wind can be heard like a human voice. It's like hearing the regretful voices of the spirits of ancestors who died at sea...
0x3623|Aoon Aoon!
0x3624|At night, the tide rises and the sandy beaches sink.
0x3625|This is a boat used for fishing.
0x3626|Alina: “If a ghost shows up, I’ll take it back!”
0x3627|Bligh: I don't find the wind as noisy as everyone says.
0x3628|Minea: Look, if you listen closely, you can hear the voices of regret from pirates who have become the scum of the sea... Minea: ...I can't hear you. I'm sorry for calling you nonsense.
0x3629|Ryan: ``It's a very gloomy way to compare the sound of the wind to the voices of the spirits of our ancestors.'' Gaso: ``It gets quiet quickly at night.'' Manya: ``It's such a waste when there's so much fun to be had at night.''
0x362A|Clift: It feels like the village has become smaller, perhaps because the tide has risen.
0x362B|Minea: Even if I stayed here, I wouldn't be able to sleep right away because of the sound of the waves.

0x3938|It looked like it was in disrepair as it had only been repaired with a board. Do you want to hide the wall?
0x3939|It looks like they are repairing the hole with a board.
0x393A|Bligh: Even if I can't see the king, Bligh will never forget my loyalty to the king! Bligh: I will protect the princess and help the king and the castle without fail!
0x393B|Clift: I wonder where and what the king and everyone in the castle are going through these days. Clift: My heart hurts just thinking about it.
0x393C|Alina: ``To tell you the truth, I was scared to come to the castle alone.'' Alina: ``...Thank you. For being with me.''
0x393D|Minea: Balzac's misdeeds, his father's death, and his journey so far... Minea: If everything is fate, then I'd be horrified and never be able to tell fortunes again.
0x393E|Manya: ``The princess lives in an amazing room.'' Manya: ``Someday, when there's peace, I'd like to come and stay the night.
0x393F|Alina: ``To tell you the truth, I was scared to come to the castle alone.'' Alina: ``...Thank you. For being with me.''
0x3940|Minea: "One day...that's right. Someday, we sisters will meet in this castle. Did Minea Obe say that we must meet in this castle just now!? It's like I don't even remember.
0x3941|When I obtained the golden bracelet and perfected the secret of evolution... At that time, the era of our dark race will come! Wahahaha!
0x3942|In order to complete the secret of evolution, a golden bracelet is required. A golden bracelet that is said to be made by Umakiba Himeba!
0x3943|It seems the experiment was a failure. I have to report to Mr. Despisaro...
0x3944|{7f45} Balzac: ``That's so stupid... My body, which is supposed to be in perfect condition, would be defeated...'' Balzac: ``But as long as I have the secret of evolution, I won't perish... At any moment... At any moment... Argh!
0x3945|{7f45} Balzac: "You idiots. It looks like you've come again. Balzac: I've already reached the ultimate level of evolution! This body is close to God. Balzac: No matter how many times I fight, it's the same thing!!
0x3946|{7f45} Balzac: "You are a superior being, surpassing both humans and monsters. Now, bow down! Balzac: "Despisarro... no! Even Despisarro will never reach me. Balzac: "Come on! You stupid, weak humans!
0x3947|Fufufufufu. Humans, what purpose do you have in this castle? I'm Balzac. I'm the current master of this castle! Balzac: I have already reached the ultimate level of evolution! This body is close to God.
0x3948|{7f45}I am Balzac. I'm the current master of this castle! Balzac: "Those of Santoheim, if you want to take back this castle, defeat me!"

0x394A|{7f45}What do you think? You must have been mistaken! I'm Balzac! Balzac: "I have already reached the ultimate level of evolution! This body is close to God. Balzac: "Despisaro-sama...no!

0x394C|Wait! Human, where are you going? ? Now get out! Snap.
0x394D|Hmph! Balzac's guy seemed to have a good feeling... I wouldn't be working for someone like that if it weren't for Despicaro-sama's orders... Snap.

0x3951|Torneko: ``...A castle with no one in it must be lonely.
0x3952|Minea: Research into the secrets of evolution is like a memento from my father. It cannot be misused. Minea: Despisaro. And the demons. We must stop those who aim for the secrets of evolution!
0x3953|Manya: ``Balzac is gone now. But your father isn't coming back either. ...Is that obvious?
0x3954|Ryan: Even Balzac is nothing more than a limb! Hmm, Despisaro must be scary... Ryan: But for now, let's take a rest. Now, let's go to town.
0x3955|Bly: A golden bracelet? Hmm... And then again, Despisaro. Bly: Have we stepped into an incredible battle?
0x3956|Clift: Even if it were a monster, it was still better to hate than an empty castle. Clift: I wonder when the people and smiles will return to Santheim.
0x3957|Arena: "It's not good yet? Even if you just defeat Balzac, your father won't come back? Arena: "...No. It's okay. It's okay. If you defeat Despisaro, I'm sure this time...
0x3958|Torneko: ``Ah, I guess we can win somehow. But I'm scared.'' Torneko: ``Now then.Anyway, I'm curious about the golden bracelet.''
0x3959|Minea: If everything started with my father's research into the secrets of evolution, then we have to stop it. Minea: Balzac...him too. No, it's nothing. Now let's go!
0x395A|Manya: I did it... I defeated Balzac... Father's Kataki... Manya: No, I'm crying... Don't look at me for a second! You look ugly when you cry!
0x395B|Bligh: What are you doing? Now, the dark monster is sitting on the throne!

0x395D|Alina: ``Kick him out and take back the castle! I'll leave everything else behind!
0x395E|Minea: Please. The monster on the throne is the result of the man who took our father's life. Minea: No matter what happens, we can't let that monster go. Please let us fight.
0x395F|Manya: “Hey! Where are you going! You must have been scared, right?
0x3960|Clift: ``The name Despisaro...I have a bad feeling about it.''
0x3961|Alina: ``Despisaro!? He's the guy from the Endor martial arts tournament! He's the boss of the monsters...? Alina: If that's the case, it's perfect. I also want to settle the match. Next up after Balzac is Despisaro!
0x3962|Manya: ``Balzac's sarcastic personality is still the same as before. ...He's always been a nasty person.
0x3963|Ryan: ``Wow! What about that guy!? A horse that looks much stronger than King Leo, a horse that looks much stronger than Himeba, and has been a king for a long time! Is he being turned into a bastard? It's painful, isn't it?
0x3964|Bligh: “This Bligh, I’m going to defeat Ayatsume no matter what! Let’s show him what he has to offer!”
0x3965|Clift: "Finally, I found it. Someone who tempts Santheim." Clift: "...Let's fight. Then we'll return this castle to its original, peaceful castle!

0x3967|Torneko: "Hey! I think I'd like to go back to the carriage if possible.
0x3968|Minea: "That's Balzac...? I feel so devious. I'm paralyzed with fear. Minea: "But I can't lose... I can't run away. Father, please use your power!
0x3969|Manya: There it is! It's him! Even though his appearance has changed, I can still see him! He... it's Balzac! Manya: He's my father. I'll take him now!

0x396E|Minea: ``Even though we're inside the castle, I feel like there's a monster. Please be careful.
0x396F|Manya: “The king isn’t there either. What exactly does that mean?
0x3970|Kiki! Well, you've come to the right place! I'm starving! After all, Balzac's guy uses it a lot. If you're jealous, envy Balzac! Kiki!
0x3971|Mela mela, you human! Get out now before you get killed!
0x3972|Kiki! The castle here in Santheim was given to me by a monster! The king of this castle is Balzac! Kiki!

0x3976|Mera Mera.... This is the castle of Santheim. But now it's a monster's castle.
0x3977|It is a landscape painting depicting mountains in spring.
0x3978|Delicious food on the table
0x3979|Eel dishes are lined up.
0x397A|There is a theological book called ``Faith and Prayer.'' It seems like something is stuck between the books. Arena's Kashidori bromide has come out!
0x397B|Ryan: ``With this, silence will come to this castle for a while. At least it's some relief.''
0x397C|Bligh: A golden bracelet? Hmm...
0x397D|Then again, Despisaro. Bligh: Have we stepped into an incredible battle?
0x397E|Clift: Even if it were a monster, it was still better to hate than an empty castle. Clift: I wonder when the people and smiles will return to Santheim.
0x397F|Alina: ``Next time I go back to the castle in Santheim, I hope everyone in the castle has returned as well.'' Alina: ``Yes! I'm sure.
0x3980|I'm growling.
0x3981|Let's do our best!
0x3982|Torneko: ``...A castle with no one around is lonely.''
0x3983|hey.
0x3984|Minea: Researching the secrets of evolution is like a keepsake from my father.
0x3985|. It cannot be misused. Minea: “Despisaro.
0x3986|And demons. I must stop those who seek the secret of evolution by giving them away!
0x3987|Manya: ``Balzac is gone now. But your father isn't coming back either. ...Is that obvious?
0x3988|Bligh: This is what it means to be a thief.
0x3989|What! ! Damn you monster!
0x398A|Alina: "It was originally your father's treasure from Santo Heim! It's not a monster's treasure! Alina: "...Why? Why is Sant Heim the only one that's going through something like this?

0x398F|Alina: ``I can't stand a demon desecrating my father's throne. I will defeat him.''
0x3990|circle!
0x3991|Minea: Nothing will change even if you defeat the underlings. Come on, Balzac!
0x3992|Manya: If you're going to hate Balzac, you're going to hate Balzac in hell! Hmph! That's a good feeling.
0x3993|Bligh: ``Yes, you monster! It's only now that you can make your own face!!
0x3994|Arena: ``...They are the ones who will die. It was the monsters! It wasn't me. Arena: ``I will not die. Defeat the boss of the monsters and restore the castle to its original state.''

0x399B|Alina: No one cares, this castle is Santheim Castle! It's not a monster's castle! Alina: I won't forgive you... I will never forgive you, monsters. I won't lose.

0x399D|I have never forgotten his name. ...Balzac. I won't allow it.
0x399E|Manya: ``Isn't that stupid Balzac the king? I'll show you how he behaves!''
0x399F|Ryan: “Hmm!? This castle is also controlled by monsters! What the heck!
0x39A0|Bligh: Only the nobles are allowed to live in castles.
0x39A1|. Not to mention monsters! Bly: ``Let's make a big deal out of you and kick him out!''
0x39A2|Clift: God, please protect the princess. Please give us strength. Clift:
0x39A3|Please give God's blessings to the disappeared people of Santheim... Please God.

0x39B7|Manya: I saw that flame in Attemto too. Maybe this castle is like Attemt?
0x39B8|Panon: "Come on! Dispel your gloomy moods with my gag!" Panon: "No, just once, I want to go to the hot spring with Alina-san..." Panon: "Wow! Don't beat me up!! I'm trying to calm down the atmosphere!

0x39C0|I'm not a bad slime. My friend's cat Mi-chan came to see me because she was worried. Mi-chan says that the king of Santheim had a mysterious power! There's someone in the town next door, Saran, who knows a lot about the king, so please ask him!
0x39C1|Meow meow meow!
0x39C2|Meow meow meow!
0x39C3|Ryan: Even though slimes and slimes are monsters, they are good-natured creatures. Ryan: This is a story about them. Believe me.

0x39D6|Torneko: "A golden bracelet worn by monsters. It's a name that evokes the blood of merchants. Torneko: "...Eh? The villains have already sent it to me.
0x39D7|Did you get it? What, I'm disappointed.

0x39E9|- Yellow Deke: "It's a castle. I wonder what happened?
0x39EA|Mummy... Mamonome~ Please hide it! Mummy.
0x39EB|I used to be an instructor for the king of Santheim. How many years ago was that? When the king was still a child. When I woke up in the middle of the night, the king was begging me. My daughter is in trouble, so please put up a sign behind the church. here we go……. Where did you set it up? I don't even remember what I wrote. The king seems to have quickly forgotten about that.
0x39EC|Oh...? This girl seems to have a familiar face.
0x39ED|When my grandpa was young, he was an instructor for the current King of Santheim. That's all that matters...
0x39EE|Books such as ``Discipline and Education,'' ``Royal Traditions,'' and ``Advice for Free Learning'' are neatly arranged.
0x39EF|Bligh: Even with the power of a king, you didn't realize that a princess could grow up like this... Bligh: Well, that's the story. Now, let's go to the back of the church and look at the sign!
0x39F0|Alina: It's behind the church! Is that sign your father? Alina: I can't stay like this. Come on, let's go to the back of the church!
0x39F1|Minea: I can't believe he knew everything about Alina-san even before he died. Minea: The King of Santoheim is a wonderful prophet.
0x39F2|Bly: “So the old man in this house is my senior? Hmm.
0x39F3|Alina: ``I wonder what your father was like when he was a child? Are you good at playing chanbara? Alina: Or climbing trees? Maybe running? Hehe, I'd like to see it.
0x39F4|Torneko: "I see, old man Tom. I wonder if you're going to church today too. I hope you're doing well.
0x39F5|I am a traveling nun from the land of Blanka. It is said that in the land of Blanca, there was a celestial maiden who fell in love with a young woodcutter. A celestial maiden is a woman who lives in the sky. Does it have something to do with the story written on the sign in the backyard?
0x39F6|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x39F7|Bligh: ``That sign was in this Saran before I knew it. I don't know the details either.
0x39F8|Alina: I've been curious about this for a long time. There's a sign in the town's backyard. Alina: But where can I get to where the sign is?
0x39F9|Manya: Come to think of it, I think I heard something like that somewhere, but I don't think I heard it? Manya: Well, it doesn't matter either way. Anyway, let's go check out the sign in the backyard!
0x39FA|Good night....
0x39FB|It's fun.... That kind king and the people of Santheim are no longer here...
0x39FC|I want to comfort this sister somehow... I'm a talker, but like Maroni, I can't even sing. I can't do it...
0x39FD|Bligh: ``It's nice to see a young girl's sleeping face. Hohoho.
0x39FE|Torneko: "Shh! Shut up! Sister is sleeping.
0x39FF|Bligh: ``Hmm... I can't believe I'm letting the folk grass fall like this. It's an insult to the royal family.
0x3A00|Alina: ``I know you're sad, but I don't want you to pretend like everyone's dead. Alina: ``Because I'm sure... that's right. After all, your fathers should still be alive.''
0x3A01|Minea: Poor thing. Her eyes are swollen from crying so much.
0x3A02|Clift: ``When you're feeling down, just having someone by your side can comfort you.'' Clift: ``I'm sure your kind heart has been felt by Sister.
0x3A03|Manya: ``His face is ugly, but he makes me cry. After all, men have hearts!''
0x3A04|ah……. I wonder where the people of Santheim were taken... King, everyone, please be safe...! God, please protect me.
0x3A05|Stop it, Maroni! The people of Santheim are definitely alive somewhere...
0x3A06|Maroni: I am the poet Maroni. Maroni: Let us offer a requiem for the people of Santheim who have already died.
0x3A07|Fumya.
0x3A08|Wan wan wan!
0x3A09|I'm Maroni, a poet. Maroni: "Hey, the sky is flowing. The spiders are flowing. Lala-la. Maroni: Now that I think about it, Princess Arena is trying to find out why the people in the castle disappeared..." Maroni: "She's chasing a man named Despisaro... Lala-la.
0x3A0A|Nii Nii.
0x3A0B|Grrrrrrrrr….
0x3A0C|We, like Alina-sama, will become strong and defeat the mysterious monsters! Yay! How! !
0x3A0D|Monsters have begun to live in the castle of Santheim. That's scary.
0x3A0E|This is Saran. It was once the castle town of Santheim. But the people in the castle disappeared... ah! I wonder what will happen to this country...!
0x3A0F|To my future daughter, I'm sure you're in trouble right now, so I'll tell you something good. It is said that far up in the sky there is a castle in the sky where the dragon god lives. The dragon god is so strong that he was able to confine the Emperor of Hell in darkness a long time ago. I think the people of Stansiara in the northern sea know more about the castle in the sky. From the King of Santheim
0x3A10|Wait a minute! That kind of equipment is dangerous! Saran Weapons and Armor Federation
0x3A11|Lucia: That's right! We sky people and the dragon god live in the sky!
0x3A12|Ryan: I can't really believe in the Dragon God or the Castle in the Sky...
0x3A13|Bligh: Hmm. Does the famously eccentric King Stansiara really know about the castle in the sky? Bligh: But I guess we'll just have to go and see it.
0x3A14|Clift: The Dragon God once sealed away the Emperor of Hell... Is this true, not a legend? Clift: It seems that in order to defeat the Emperor of Hell, we must meet the Dragon God at all costs.
0x3A15|Alina: ``Father...'' Alina: ``......'' Alina: ``Thank you, father. Thank you...''
0x3A16|Torneko: ``It kind of reminds me of Popolo. The little king is such a shame.''
0x3A17|Minea: Ah, I can hear it... Is this also the voice of guidance? King Santoheim again? Minea: To Stansiara. We must go to Stansiara.
0x3A18|Manya: A castle in the sky...? A dragon god...? It's not a children's picture book. Manya: Anyway, let's go to Stansiara!
0x3A19|Bligh: ``I'm worried about the king's safety, but right now I have to protect the princess first.Bligh: Even if the worst happens, as long as the princess is still alive.The blood of the royal family will never die.''
0x3A1A|Minea: ``My sisters and I were once overwhelmed by despair.'' Minea: ``But if we don't give up, morning will come someday.I'm sure...''
0x3A1B|Clift: Maroni sometimes says cruel things.
0x3A1C|Alina: ``Even if everyone in the world told me that my father was dead, I wouldn't believe it.'' Alina: ``My father and everyone in the castle must be alive somewhere. They're waiting for my help.
0x3A1D|Toruneko: ``You have to think about things in a positive way!'' Toruneko: ``I think that you should never give up hope until the very end, right?
0x3A1E|Panon: What is the most popular dish at Saran's restaurant? Panon: Salad!
0x3A1F|Lucia: ``I'm a little tired. I'm sleepy.
0x3A20|Ryan: I heard that there's a famous poet in this town...oh, is that so?
0x3A21|Bligh: ``For now, let's go to the inn. If something happens to us, we'll be lost.''
0x3A22|Clift: Even though it's a beautiful night, my heart doesn't lighten up. Oh, God...
0x3A23|Alina: ``...Everyone from the castle is hiding somewhere in the town of Saran, and they're trying to scare me.'' Alina: ``As I walked a little further, my father suddenly appeared and gave me his testimonies.'' Alina: ``If that's the case... no wonder...
0x3A24|Minea: There's also a way to tell fortunes by looking at the moon reflected in the river. Did you know?
0x3A25|Manya: It's like that in any town, but this town feels particularly lonely at night.
0x3A26|Bligh: Come to think of it, I've been following Despisaro all the way from Endor. Bligh: However, his true identity still remains a mystery. What kind of man is he?
0x3A27|Clift: ``Maroni's singing voice is also nostalgic.It makes me feel a little relieved.''
0x3A28|Alina: "Kang. I understand. It's all Despisaro's fault! Alina: If I find him, I won't forgive him at all!
0x3A29|Minea: ``Despisaro... Just hearing that name makes me feel like my whole body is in pain. Minea: ``That's a scary name.Despisaro.''
0x3A2A|Bligh: ``It's fun to be a tomboy when things like this happen.
0x3A2B|Alina: ``We have to make the world peaceful for that child's sake as soon as possible. I can't stay depressed.''
0x3A2C|Manya: “Arena is pretty famous locally. I wonder how popular it is compared to mine.
0x3A2D|Ryan: There must have been soldiers in the castle, too. Even so, it's an opponent they can't compete with. It's terrifying...
0x3A2E|Alina: “Monsters are so big. Father...
0x3A2F|Torneko: Rumors about fellow merchants travel around the world in the blink of an eye. Torneko: "I'm sure they won't let Santheim go." Heaven has given you the king, and the king is the keystone of the country. We must do something about it before the country collapses.
0x3A30|Clift: God, please comfort the hearts of the people of Saran who were left behind.
0x3A31|Arena: ``Everyone in the country is worried too. We need to defeat the monsters and restore the castle to its original state as soon as possible!
0x3A32|Ryan: ``Preparing your equipment is the basics of traveling.It's a good idea to keep this in mind.
0x3A33|Arena: “It’s nostalgic. This signboard too…”
0x3A34|Torneko: ``Hmm. That's something I've thought about! I think I'll try putting up an advertisement on a billboard.
0x3A35|Panon: What is the most popular dish at Saran's restaurant? Panon: Salad!
0x3A36|Panon: Look! The river is flowing freely through the town of Saran! Panon: Hahaha, there's still a long way to go. It's going on and on.
0x3A37|Lucia: ``That's wrong! I hope that's a church and not a tower in the sky!''
0x3A38|Ryan: I hear there's a famous poet in this town.
0x3A39|Bligh: It seems like Saran is doing well even in the king's absence. Quite a lot!
0x3A3A|Clift: The people of Saran are safe, so why only the castle of Santheim? What on earth are the demons for? Clift: Hmm... grumbling.
0x3A3B|Alina: ``...The town of Saran hasn't changed.
0x3A3C|Torneko: ``The shops in this town are all on good terms with each other. It's also famous among its fellow merchants. Torneko: ``That's why the traveling merchants seem to be having trouble doing business.
0x3A3D|Minea: ``I can hear the murmuring of the river. It's a nice, calm town.
0x3A3E|Manya: “I can’t find any bars or casinos. Hmm, that’s boring!
0x3A3F|I'm a history researcher. It is said that once upon a time, the successive kings of Santheim were able to know the future. If that's the case, I wonder if the current king also had that kind of power.
0x3A40|Bligh: It's true that successive kings foresaw disasters that would befall the country and successfully prevented them. Bligh: Hmm. I understand now.
0x3A41|Clift: So the monsters are afraid of King Santoheim's power...? Clift: No, it's too early to decide. Hmm, what happened in the castle?
0x3A42|Alina: Come to think of it, that time. Even when I lost my voice, my father had a terrifying dream. Alina: Are you saying that your father was able to know what would happen in the future through dreams?
0x3A43|Manya: "Hmm. Well then, Minea, who can predict the future through fortune-telling, is also a member of the royal family!? Manya: "Then we're the older sisters of Arena, aren't we? Ahahahahaha.
0x3A44|Alina: “I never thought there was a shop in a place like this! I didn’t know.
0x3A45|Torneko: ``I'm sure there's a lot of business in a place like this. I wonder if they have a good selection of products?''

0x3BC5|I also practiced singing so I wouldn't lose to Maroni. Okay? Let's sing!
0x3BC6|Hmmmmmm. Please, please don't let that person sing...
0x3BC7|Hmmmmmm….
0x3BC8|I am a soldier who was stationed at Santheim. That day, the king gave me the message from the dream.But that morning, I left the castle on business. The minister said that the king has something to say about the Emperor of Hell.
0x3BC9|oh! Princess Arena! Ohisashu is here! I am a soldier who served in Santheim a long time ago. The day everyone disappeared. The king wanted to convey the message of his dream to everyone in the castle. Unfortunately, I left the castle that morning on business... The minister said that the king had something to say about the Emperor of Hell.

0x3BCF|Clift: Could this person be one of the soldiers who served Santheim? Clift: ...But I feel bad for waking up a sleeping person. Let's come back tomorrow morning.
0x3BD0|Alina: "Oh? I feel like I've seen this person somewhere...?
0x3BD1|Manya: ``I'm really upset. I wonder if I'm dreaming about being chased by debt collectors.''
0x3BD2|Bligh: Looks like the Emperor of Hell holds the key to the disappearance of the entire castle. Bligh: Doesn't anyone know the more detailed story?
0x3BD3|Clift: The Emperor of Hell!? Is that the one who is King Santheim?! Clift: But can we stand up to the Emperor of Hell on our own? I'm worried.
0x3BD4|Minea: Dream prophecy...? Did King Santheim have the same power of prophecy as me?
0x3BD5|Bligh: Looks like the Emperor of Hell holds the key to the disappearance of the entire castle. Bligh: Doesn't anyone know the more detailed story?
0x3BD6|Clift: The Emperor of Hell!? Is that the one who is King Santheim?! Clift: But can we stand up to the Emperor of Hell on our own? I'm worried.

0x3D58|Hmmmmmm. Please, please don't let that person sing...
0x3D59|Hmmmmmm….
0x3D5A|I am a soldier who was stationed at Santheim. That day, the king tried to convey the message of his dream to everyone in the castle. Unfortunately, I left the castle that morning on business... The minister said that the king has something to say about the Emperor of Hell.
0x3D5B|oh! Princess Arena! Ohisashu is here! I am a soldier who served in Santheim a long time ago. The day everyone disappeared. The king wanted to convey the message of his dream to everyone in the castle. Unfortunately, I left the castle that morning on business... The minister said that the king had something to say about the Emperor of Hell.
0x3D5C|Ryan: ``I don't really know much about singing or dancing, but is the current singing bad? Ryan: ``Hmm. I didn't think it was that bad. Is it bad? Or is it? Hmm.

0x3D61|Bligh: Hmm. That guy's songs are still making progress. It's starting to hurt my ears.
0x3D62|``I can sleep anytime, anywhere, so I don't understand how painful it is for people who can't sleep.''
0x3D63|Clift: Could this person be one of the soldiers who served Santheim? Clift: ...But I feel bad for waking up a sleeping person. Let's come back tomorrow morning.
0x3D64|Alina: "Oh? I feel like I've seen this person somewhere...?
0x3D65|Manya: ``I'm really upset. I wonder if I'm dreaming about being chased by debt collectors.''
0x3D66|Bligh: Looks like the Emperor of Hell holds the key to the disappearance of the entire castle. Bligh: Doesn't anyone know the more detailed story?
0x3D67|Clift: The Emperor of Hell!? Is that the one who is King Santheim?! Clift: But can we stand up to the Emperor of Hell on our own? I'm worried.
0x3D68|Minea: Dream prophecy...? Did King Santheim have the same power of prophecy as me?
0x3D69|Bligh: Looks like the Emperor of Hell holds the key to the disappearance of the entire castle. Bligh: Doesn't anyone know the more detailed story?
0x3D6A|Clift: The Emperor of Hell!? Is that the one who is King Santheim?! Clift: But can we stand up to the Emperor of Hell on our own? I'm worried.
0x3D6B|Alina: ``I'm glad... at least one person was saved! I'm really glad.'' Alina: ``Your father had a dream about the Emperor of Hell, and then he disappeared. . . . I'm curious.

0x3FD6|Hoffman: ``Someone who is so strange that I can't even begin to describe it has come. What he's saying is strange, too...'' Hoffman: ``But, I guess it's fine if there's at least one person like that. I'm sorry for the two of them though.''
0x3FD7|Hoffman: ``I never expected that such a high-ranking Hoffman would move to such a deserted place...'' Hoffman: ``I was half happy.
0x3FD8|Hoffman: When a poet comes here, I feel like the level of culture here has risen. Hoffman: But in reality, it's still just a wasteland, so I want to be able to call it a town as soon as possible. Hoffman: Now, aim to become a town with a high level of culture, and gather new immigrants!
0x3FD9|Hoffman: ``If someone who can fight comes here, we can live in peace here, too, as if we were all prisoners.'' Hoffman: ``As expected of you, Mr. {7f4b}. You have a different perspective. You can really help us.
0x3FDA|Hoffman: Well, I understand that you like animals, {7f4b}, but I need some help. Hoffman: Next time, please bring in some human immigrants. Please!
0x3FDB|Hoffman: In order to build a town, you first need someone who can do the hard work. Hoffman: In that respect, the Hobbits can be relied on. Please keep gathering people like this.
0x3FDC|Hoffman: ``To turn this barren land into a place, we need agriculture.''
0x3FDD|The whole collection is from Hantaka, isn't it? Hoffman: As expected of you, Mr. {7f4b}. That's an excellent decision. I'll keep it up.
0x3FDE|Hoffman: ``It's a pity that we didn't have a church to welcome the sisters even though we had them come...'' Hoffman: ``We can't live like this. Mr. {7f4b}, please gather people to build a church as soon as possible!''
0x3FDF|Hoffman: Even though the mother of God has gone to great lengths, there is still no church here. Hoffman: We can't live like this. Mr. {7f4b}, please gather people to build a church as soon as possible!
0x3FE0|Hoffman: "As expected of you, Mr. {7f4b}, to invite such a sexy person to this empty place! Hoffman: But, it seems like you can't concentrate on building the town. The way she's looking at you...
0x3FE1|Hoffman: “Sand like this
0x3FE2|A sailor would come right in the middle... Hoffman: {7f4b}, what exactly did you recommend? Hoffman: Well, as long as he helps build the town, I don't mind...
0x3FE3|Hoffman: No matter how you look at that figure, he's a prisoner...? Hoffman: No. But he's also someone who came all the way here to help build the town. Hoffman: He's like that.
0x3FE4|Nri Shushin Rehoffman Meha is a nice person. Hey, please say yes!
0x3FE5|HOFFMAN: ``Someone with a bad attitude has come here...'' HOFFMAN: ``No, no, I don't think it's a good idea for the town to judge people based on their appearance.''
0x3FE6|``During this period, I lost my ability as a person.''
0x3FE7|! But I have to believe that Yonosu is my friend who is building the town together.
0x3FE8|Hoffman: Even though the bartender has come, there isn't even a bar here yet. Hoffman: This can't be done. Please get more people together so we can open a bar as soon as possible.
0x3FE9|Hoffman: ``That's nice, Ms. Maid. She works hard, and above all, it's refreshing to see her.'' Hoffman: ``...Oops, I'm not particularly fond of maids, after all!'' Hoffman: ``What I just said is just a generalization... Just keep up the good work.''
0x3FEA|Hoffman: “As expected of Sand.
0x3FEB|This place is familiar to merchants as it used to be a bazaar. Hoffman: ``Looks like they've started some kind of business right away. You can count on me.'' Hoffman: ``Please continue to recommend this place to many people.
0x3FEC|Hoffman: ``No matter how much we need young workers to build a town, it doesn't matter...'' Hoffman: ``This place...
0x3FED|There is no place for my family to live, so please bring an adult who can work properly.
0x3FEE|Hoffman: ``Um... if possible, could you please bring in more young people instead of the elderly?'' Hoffman: ``No, I'm not saying we can't bring in the elderly. It's just that...'' Hoffman: ``For that reason, I would like you to focus on young, active people.
0x3FEF|Hoffman: ``I lost my mother, so I feel strangely close to a woman of that stature.'' Hoffman: ``Even when we work together, she's the creepy one, and she's dependable, and she's a good cook.'' Hoffman: ``...That's nice, Auntie.''
0x3FF0|Hoffman: ``Even a barren place like this would be much easier if women were there.'' Hoffman: ``Please continue to recommend this place to as many people as you can.''
0x3FF1|Hoffman: After all, we need men to build a town. I'm sure Mr. {7f4b} understands that. Hoffman: Please continue to recommend this place to many people.
0x3FF2|Hoffman: ``To build a town on this land, we need manpower.'' Hoffman: ``I'm going to write a lot of books in this world. I'm sure you'll meet people who want to move there.'' Hoffman: ``When you meet people like that, could you please recommend this place?'' Hoffman: ``If people gather together, I'm sure a great town will be born in this barren land!''

0x4471|Would you like to tell this person about Medal King's Castle?
0x4472|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x4473|It's amazing that a town was built in such a place. From now on, I'm going to sell all kinds of things and sell them.
0x4474|Yo!
0x4475|Hoffman: ``Okay, now we've decided on a name for the town...'' Hoffman: ``Ah, then I've decided to leave this town and move to a nearby hut.'' Hoffman: ``The people who are planning the town should do it as quietly as possible.
0x4476|People's self-esteem is also very different. HOFFMAN: When you're in town, you're bound to want to show your mouth. This is to avoid that. HOFFMAN: From now on, I'm going to...
0x4477|I'm thinking of devoting myself to managing people and acting as a consultant. Hoffman: Everyone, please continue to help us gather people. Hoffman: Well then, everyone. Let's work together for the development of <TOWN>!
0x4478|Hoffman: I see. So let's start from the beginning again.
0x4479|Hoffman: So, the name of this town is <TOWN>, right?
0x447A|Hoffman: <TOWN>? Yeah, that's a good name. I can't even think of it!
0x447B|Hoffman: Well, I'd be happy if the name turned out to be something I came up with.
0x447C|Hoffman: Oh? In the end, is it okay to go with the <TOWN> that I came up with?
0x447D|Hoffman: ``Hello, that's what I was thinking. <TOWN>'' after all. That was the work I was most proud of.
0x447E|Hoffman: ``Hmm. After all, it was impossible for me to come up with a cool name for a town...'' Hoffman: ``Well, I have no choice. From now on, I'll just have to rely on {7f4b} and the others.'' Hoffman: ``Please, come up with a cool name for a town that I wouldn't be able to think of.''
0x447F|Hoffman: "So you came? I thought you would say so, so I saved my favorite for later." Hoffman: "Okay, let's go. <HERO> Alley! Hehe. How did it go!?
0x4480|Hoffman: "Oh, I knew it! I thought it wasn't good either. So, what about the next one? Hoffman: <HERO> Land. It's pretty good, isn't it? Did you like it?
0x4481|Hoffman: Well, first, I'll tell you what I thought of as a candidate. Please think carefully before deciding. Hoffman: First, <HERO> Town. How do you like it?
0x4482|Hoffman: What do you think? You've completely changed your mind after you've been here for a while, right? Hoffman: Thanks to the hard work of the immigrants, this place is starting to look more like a town. Hoffman: So, I'm thinking of giving this place a name that feels more like a town... I think I'll leave it up to everyone who is cooperating with me to decide.
0x4483|Hoffman: Oh, everyone! I've been waiting for you.
0x4484|Manya: ``It's nice to come to a place with fresh air once in a while, right? Once in a while is fine. Once in a while.''
0x4485|Ryan: ``For the sake of the people of this town, hurry up.''
0x4486|Bligh: ``I wonder which will be faster, for this place to become a town, or for the princess to get married.'' Hm.
0x4487|Minea: Don't you feel more at ease in a peaceful town like this than in the city? Minea: Mr. Hoffman is calling this a bigger town.
0x4488|Torneko: ``If I buy this land now, will I be able to make a profit?''
0x4489|Clift: Look! Everyone is working with shining faces. Clift: I'm sure this town will become a wonderful town!

0x4907|Would you like to tell this person about Medal King's Castle?
0x4908|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x4909|Hey hey! I don't like it, I don't like it! However, it is still in preparation. I'm sorry...
0x490A|Hoffman: ``Okay, now we've decided on a name for the town...'' Hoffman: ``Oh, and I've decided to leave this town and move to a nearby cabin.'' Hoffman: ``The town has been decided upon.''
0x490B|Residents want to leave things to the autonomy of the residents as little as possible without giving their opinions. Hoffman: When you're in the town, you're bound to want to vent. This is to avoid that. Hoffman: From now on, I'm planning to dedicate myself to managing residents and acting as a consultant. Hoffman: Everyone, please continue to help us gather people. Hoffman: Well then, everyone. Let's work together to develop <TOWN>!
0x490C|Hoffman: I see. So let's start from the beginning again.
0x490D|Hoffman: So, the name of this town is <TOWN>, right?
0x490E|Hoffman: <TOWN>? Yeah, that's a good name. I can't even think of it!
0x490F|Hoffman: Well, I'd be happy if the name turned out to be something I came up with.
0x4910|Hoffman: “Hey?
0x4911|Is it okay to use the <TOWN> that I came up with?
0x4912|Hoffman: ``Hey, that's what I was thinking. It's <TOWN> after all. That's what I'm most confident about.''
0x4913|It was.
0x4914|Hoffman: ``Hmm. After all, it was impossible for me to come up with a cool name for a town...'' Hoffman: ``Well, I have no choice. From now on, I'll just have to rely on {7f4b} and the others.'' Hoffman: ``Please, come up with a cool name for a town that I wouldn't be able to think of.''
0x4915|Hoffman: So you came? I thought you said that, so I saved it for last. Hoffman: Well, let's go. <HERO> Yokocho! Hehe. How did it go?
0x4916|Hoffman: "Oh, I knew it! I thought it wasn't good either. So, what about the next one? Hoffman: <HERO> Land. It's pretty good, isn't it? Did you like it?
0x4917|Hoffman: Well, first of all, please think carefully and decide on the candidate that I came up with.Hoffman: First of all, go ahead and say <HERO>! Do you like it?
0x4918|HOFFMAN: What do you think? Within a while, I was completely confused by the word HOFFMAN, right? HOFFMAN: Thanks to the hard work of the immigrants, this place is starting to look more like a town. HOFFMAN: So, I'm thinking about giving this place a name that feels more like a town... HOFFMAN: I've thought of a few options, but I just can't decide. HOFFMAN: Well, I'm going to start attracting more immigrants.
0x4919|So
0x491A|I think I'll leave it up to all of you to decide.
0x491B|Hoffman: Oh, everyone! I've been waiting for you.

0x4A9A|There is a diary with no name written on it. I picked up <NAME> and read it. ○Monday × Day A big building was built in the town. Can we still call it a town? Apparently there are plans to build a church building next, but I personally don't agree with that. If anything, I'd like to see a building that makes the town's direction more clear.

0x4D98|somewhat! ! When are you going? ? picture? Don't you know who I am? It's more about business than that.
0x4D99|Hoffman: ``Okay, now we've decided on the name of the town...'' Hoffman: ``Ah, then I've decided to leave this town and move to a nearby cabin.'' Hoffman: ``When it comes to building a town, I want to leave it up to the autonomy of the residents without showing their opinions as much as possible.'' Hoffman: ``When you're in a town, you're bound to want to expose your mouth. This is to avoid that.'' Hoffman: ``From now on... I'm thinking of devoting myself to managing the residents and acting as a consultant.Hoffman: Everyone, please continue to help us gather people.Hoffman: Well then, everyone.Let's work together to develop <TOWN>!
0x4D9A|Hoffman: I see. So let's start from the beginning again.
0x4D9B|Hoffman: So, the name of this town is <TOWN>, right?
0x4D9C|Hoffman: <TOWN>? Yeah, that's a good name. I can't even think of it!
0x4D9D|Hoffman: Well, I'd be happy if the name turned out to be something I came up with.
0x4D9E|Hoffman: Oh? In the end, is it okay to go with the <TOWN> that I came up with?
0x4D9F|Hoffman: ``Hello, that's what I was thinking. <TOWN>'' after all. That was the work I was most proud of.
0x4DA0|Hoffman: ``Hmm. After all, it was impossible for me to come up with a cool name for a town...'' Hoffman: ``Well, I have no choice. From now on, I'll just have to rely on {7f4b} and the others.'' Hoffman: ``Please, come up with a cool name for a town that I wouldn't be able to think of.''
0x4DA1|Hoffman: "I guess that's what you came for. I thought you would say that, so I saved my favorite for last. It's a big deal. <HERO> Yokocho! Hehehe. How did it go!?
0x4DA2|Hoffman: "Oh, I knew it! I thought it wasn't good either. So, what about the next one? Hoffman: <HERO> Land. It's pretty good, isn't it? Did you like it?
0x4DA3|Hoffman: Well, first, I'll tell you what I thought of as a candidate. Please think carefully before deciding. Hoffman: First, <HERO> Town. How do you like it?
0x4DA4|Hoffman: What do you think? You've completely changed your mind after you've been here for a while, right? Hoffman: Thanks to the hard work of the immigrants, this place is starting to look more like a town. Hoffman: So, I'm thinking of giving this place a name that feels more like a town... I think I'll leave it up to everyone who is cooperating with me to decide.
0x4DA5|Hoffman: Oh, everyone! I've been waiting for you.
0x4DA6|Minea: Even with my fortune-telling, I don't know what the future will hold for this town. Minea: Since you're talking about Mr. Hoffman, I'm sure it's going to be a wonderful town.
0x4DA7|Torneko: ``At construction sites, bento boxes sell with great enthusiasm! Torneko: ``Ah, what a great opportunity. No, traveling is my priority, right?

Apparently there are plans to build a church building next, but I personally don't agree with that. If anything, I'd like to see a building that makes the town's direction more clear.

0x5525|Would you like to tell me about King Dal's castle?
0x5526|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x5527|Thanks to you, this town has grown and my business is doing well. Well now...
0x5528|Hoffmann: ``Okay, now we've decided on a name for the town...'' Hoffmann: ``Oh, and I've decided to leave this town and move to a nearby cabin.'' Hoffmann: ``The people who are building the town are going to give me as much attention as possible.''
0x5529|As a resident myself. Hoffmann..."Nima Hoffmann: ``When I'm in town, I can't help but feel angry.''
0x552A|You'll want to do it. This is to avoid that. Hoffman: ``From now on, I'm thinking of devoting myself to managing the residents and acting as a consultant.'' Hoffman: ``I hope everyone will continue to help others.'' Hoffman: ``Okay, everyone. Let's work together to develop <TOWN>!''
0x552B|Hoffman: I see. So let's start from the beginning again.
0x552C|Hoffman: So, the name of this town is <TOWN>, right?
0x552D|Hoffman: <TOWN>? Yeah, that's a good name. I can't even think of it!
0x552E|Hoffman: Well, I'd be happy if the name turned out to be something I came up with.
0x552F|Hoffman: Oh? In the end, is it okay to go with the <TOWN> that I came up with?
0x5530|Hoffman: ``Hello, that's what I was thinking. <TOWN>'' after all. That was the work I was most proud of.
0x5531|Hoffman: ``Hmm. After all, it was impossible for me to come up with a cool name for a town...'' Hoffman: ``Well, I have no choice. From now on, I'll just have to rely on {7f4b} and the others.'' Hoffman: ``Please, come up with a cool name for a town that I wouldn't be able to think of.''
0x5532|Hoffman: I guess you're right. I thought you would say that, so I saved my favorite for last. Hoffman: Well, let's go. <HERO> Alley! Hehe. How did it go?
0x5533|Hoffman: "Oh, I knew it! I thought it wasn't good either. So, what about the next one? Hoffman: <HERO> Land. It's pretty good, isn't it? Did you like it?
0x5534|Hoffman: Well, first, I'll tell you what I thought of as a candidate. Please think carefully before deciding. Hoffman: First, <HERO> Town. How do you like it?
0x5535|Hoffman: What do you think? You've completely changed the look after you've been here for a while, haven't you? Hoffman: Thanks to the hard work of the immigrants, this place has started to look more like a town. Hoffman:
0x5536|So
0x5537|I'm thinking of giving this place a name that is typical of the town, but... Hoffman: I've thought of a few options, but I just can't decide. Hoffman: At this point, I think I'll let everyone who is cooperating with immigrants make the decision.
0x5538|Hoffman: Oh, everyone! I've been waiting for you.
0x5539|Always smiling happy shop
0x553A|Bligh: Even though the town was built by my friend Hoffmann, this is legitimate Santheim territory. Bligh: We'll have to get them to pay taxes someday. Hm. I don't mind giving them a small discount.
0x553B|Clift: ``A newly built house on the hill. It has a red roof, white walls, and beautiful flowers are blooming in the garden. Clift: ``Someday, I'll live a sweet life in a house like that...'' Wow! Did you hear that!?
0x553C|Ryan: ``Hmm, this is it!...If things change, things will change.''

0x5E45|Would you like to tell this person about Medal King's Castle?
0x5E46|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x5E47|This is a town full of dreams and hopes. Please take your time.
0x5E48|welcome! To <TOWN>!
0x5E49|The number of people in this town is increasing, and it looks like something big is going to be built here.
0x5E4A|We are a happy shop. No, it looks like something is going to be built where I was before, so I had to move out. Now...
0x5E4B|Hoffman: ``Okay, now we've decided on the name of the town...'' Hoffman: ``Ah, then I've decided to leave this town and move to a nearby cabin.'' Hoffman: ``When it comes to building a town, I want to leave it up to the autonomy of the residents without showing their opinions as much as possible.'' Hoffman: ``When you're in a town, you're bound to want to expose your mouth. This is to avoid that.'' Hoffman: ``From now on... I'm thinking of devoting myself to managing the residents and acting as a consultant.Hoffman: Everyone, please continue to help us gather people.Hoffman: Well then, everyone.Let's work together to develop <TOWN>!
0x5E4C|Hoffman: I see. So let's start from the beginning again.
0x5E4D|Hoffman: So, the name of this town is <TOWN>, right?
0x5E4E|Hoffman: <TOWN>? Yeah, that's a good name. I can't even think of it!
0x5E4F|Hoffman: Well, I'd be happy if the name turned out to be something I came up with.
0x5E50|Hoffman: Oh? In the end, is it okay to go with the <TOWN> that I came up with?
0x5E51|Hoffman: ``Hello, that's what I was thinking. <TOWN>'' after all. That was the work I was most proud of.
0x5E52|Hoffman: ``Hmm. After all, it was impossible for me to come up with a cool name for a town...'' Hoffman: ``Well, I have no choice. From now on, I'll just have to rely on {7f4b} and the others.'' Hoffman: ``Please, come up with a cool name for a town that I wouldn't be able to think of.''
0x5E53|Hoffman: I guess you're right. I thought you would say that, so I saved my favorite for last. Hoffman: Well, let's go. <HERO> Alley! Hehe. How did it go?
0x5E54|Hoffman: "Oh, I knew it! I thought it wasn't good either. So, what about the next one? Hoffman: <HERO> Land. It's pretty good, isn't it? Did you like it?
0x5E55|Hoffman: Well, first, I'll tell you what I thought of as a candidate. Please think carefully before deciding. Hoffman: First, <HERO> Town. How do you like it?
0x5E56|Hoffman: What do you think? You've completely changed your mind after you've been here for a while, haven't you? Hoffman: Thanks to the hard work of the immigrants, this place has started to look more like a town. Hoffman: So, I'm thinking about giving this place a more town-like name, but I can't decide whether to gather here or not. Hoffman: ``At this point, I think I'll leave it up to everyone who is helping us gather immigrants to decide.''
0x5E57|Hoffman: Oh, everyone! I've been waiting for you.
0x5E58|Always Nico Nico Happy Shop has moved.
0x5E59|Manya: Hey, hey! That's the guy I passed by earlier. He was glancing at me. Manya: Hmmm. Beautiful women are tough. They always attract attention. That's a problem, isn't it?
0x5E5A|Torneko: ``I wish we had bought the land here earlier and opened a branch.Ah...'' Torneko: ``After we become such a nice town, the land would be so expensive that we wouldn't be able to afford it.Hohoho.
0x5E5B|Alina: ``If it's such a big town, there must be a lot of strong people here!'' Alina: ``I want to fight. I want to have a match. But who should I start with?''

0x691D|There is a diary with no name written on it. I picked up <NAME> and read it. ○Monday × Day Meetings are held almost every day to decide the future direction of the town. The discussion was wawa wa wa wa wa wai wa mi. I've never had a problem with it. Some say they want a big church, while others say they want to build a casino. There's no way things will be resolved at this rate.

0x843D|There is a diary with no name written on it. I picked up <NAME> and read it. A lot has happened on ○ month x day, but this town has become even better. Mr. Hoffman also said that the town was finally completed, but it seems like he was not really convinced. What are you planning to do now? That person's ambition to improve is truly astounding.

0x8F4E|Oh, it sold, it sold. As you can see, this is the best place to be since it's close to the entrance to town. It would be a pain if all the items for sale were sold. It was bad.

0x8F50|Manya: What do you think would be good to soothe a battle-weary heart? Manya: Well, shopping! I want a new dress.
0x8F51|Bligh: ``Are you sure? Don't get too excited and go shopping. Bligh: Check the item carefully, think about it three times, and still buy it when you want it!
0x8F52|Torneko: "I'll do it! I'll do it! I can smell a rare product! Torneko: "Come on! Hurry up! I have to take a look at the store from the front.

0xB549|There is an old book written ``In Search of the Magic Wand, Chapter 6''. I picked up <NAME> and read it. I am the wizard Madrue. I was looking for a magic wand at the behest of my lord, King Santheim. In this world, people tend to think that a story ends in chapter 5, so I purposely decided to leave chapter 6 in this book. Now that I'm old enough, the days when I traveled in search of that magic wand are already a distant memory. But to my surprise, now that I'm retired, I've discovered the ultimate walking stick. Its name is Hinoki no Bou. It's a magic wand that I can't carry anywhere with my weak legs. Come to think of it, it will soon be my king's birthday. I think I'll give this magic wand as a gift. Like me, the king is old...

0xF54E|Bligh: When so many people gather together, it's no longer just a town, it's a country. Bligh: That's also the result of our efforts. Hm.
0xF54F|Manya: ``Alright! Let's dance here to make Hoffman bald!'' Manya: ``That's what I thought, but it's a place with no lights or music. Stop it! Stop it!''
0xF550|There are so many!
0xF551|However, Mr. Hoffman's work will also increase. I hope I don't damage my body.
0xF552|People from all over the world gather in this town
0xF553|Gagene! I'm kind of excited.
0xF554|When I meet Mr. Hoffman, I remember the time we traveled together.
0xF555|Manya: ``Hmm. This house is more tidy than I thought.
0xF556|Torneko: ``Mr. Hoffman, it seems like you're working hard every day. I want to support you.''
0xF557|Does Koteko control the comings and goings of people in the town? He's a very serious man.

0xFFD9|Mummy... I'll have it released in the theater tonight... Become a star quickly and make your parents happy. Grrrr...
0xFFDA|Panon: ``Aiming to be a star? That's right, you're a star!'' Panon: ``Hmm, that's pretty tough.
0xFFDB|Manya: ``This person still hasn't been allowed to appear on stage.'' Manya: ``He's been here long before Minea and I came here, but we wouldn't be here if he hadn't.
0xFFDC|Torneko: ``Becoming a star and being filial to your parents really makes me cry.
0xFFDD|I guess I can't listen to Panon anymore. I feel so lonely....
0xFFDE|I didn't get any work today either... When can I make my debut? Hohoho.
0xFFDF|It seems that Linda made it out of town safely with the priest. The two of them should be living happily somewhere by now...
0xFFE0|Uppu! Yube's Panon stage was interesting.
0xFFE1|Clift: ``I don't care about anything, but if I had some talent, I might have lived a different life than I do now...'' Clift: ``Oh, no, it's not that I don't like being a priest. Yes.
0xFFE2|Ryan: ``If you're a man, stick to your initial aspirations. If you don't give up, you'll definitely be able to make your debut someday.''
0xFFE3|Minea: This person has no talent, so the best thing to do is to go back to the countryside where your parents are waiting.
0xFFE4|Panon: ``Although it was only for a short time, I'm really happy that everyone in the town was able to enjoy my performance.''
0xFFE5|Minea: Before you knew it, Mr. Panon had become one of the most popular people in Montbarbara.
0xFFE6|Clift: Since Pannon was on stage, did the dancers not dance? Clift: Oh, no, it's not like I want to see the dancers dance.He's definitely very popular as a dancer in Montbarbara.
0xFFE7|Bligh: If it's as interesting as that person says, I'd definitely like to see Panon perform on stage.
0xFFE8|The Emperor of Hell isn't going to come back to life in the slightest if it's just a rumor! If you can revive something, come revive it! Hiccup.
0xFFE9|Drinking after work is the best. Kaa, it’s delicious!
0xFFEA|Welcome. Let's drink, sing, and forget all the bad things!
0xFFEB|Apparently there is a large island surrounded by rocky mountains in the sea far east of here. And it turns out that there is a castle of monsters on that island.
0xFFEC|No one has ever entered that island and returned alive. Just watch it.
0xFFED|Hoho, across the sea to this town? Have you seen another rocky island?
0xFFEE|It is decorated with a painting depicting a sunset over Montbarbara.
0xFFEF|Minea: If we don't do something quickly, the rumors about the Emperor of Hell may spread to more people. Minea: Before that happens, we have to turn the Emperor of Hell into darkness!
0xFFF0|Ryan: ``I can't believe that the rumors about the Emperor of Hell have spread to the people of the town...'' Ryan: ``We must stop the Emperor's resurrection and reassure the people as soon as possible!
0xFFF1|Alina: “Ah, yes, yes. Someday, when you can drink again, I will protect you.
0xFFF2|Bligh: ``It's okay, Princess. Even if you drink alcohol, don't get drunk! Please protect yourself properly.
0xFFF3|Ryan: <HERO> I'm sorry, but let's have a drink.
0xFFF4|Minea: "There's no progress, sis...
0xFFF5|Manya: “Today, tomorrow, and the day after, drink and sing and forget all the bad things cleanly and refreshingly!
0xFFF6|Puffum Suya! Yes, end it. This is a puffy spell that will make you attractive to girls. From now on, live your life with confidence.
0xFFF7|? ? ?
0xFFF8|Pafurinko Pafurinko....
0xFFF9|………….
0xFFFA|yes. Puff, puff, puff….
0xFFFB|Well then, I'll do it.
0xFFFC|Yes, that's unfortunate. If you change your mind, come back.
0xFFFD|This is Puff Puff's room. Hey? Pafupafu?
0xFFFE|Do you want to work here too? It's better to stop. Pafupafu is surprisingly difficult.
0xFFFF|fault? With a companion? You have to come by yourself.
0x10000|When I'm here, I'm attracted to girls. Wahahaha.
0x10001|Imae Paichi: ``I'm dealing with this person. Please do it again.''
0x10002|A girl named Linda used to live in this room, and now she's happy.
0x10003|It seems that he lives in
0x10004|It is decorated with beautifully drawn landscape paintings.
0x10005|Alina: “No one said anything about working!
0x10006|Daikema
0x10007|Hey princess! Working at a store like this is the first step on the path to evil.
0x10008|Clift: ``If the Princess were to work here, I would be happy to come by her every day.'' Clift: ``Ah, what I did to her was so disrespectful to the Princess. Please forgive me.''
0x10009|Minea: If my sister works here, I feel like she will force me to work here too...
0x1000A|Manya: “Hmm, I’m going to feel a bit sullen once this trip is over.
0x1000B|``It might be good to work here.''
0x1000C|<HERO>What? Don't even think about secretly coming alone at night.
0x1000D|Huh?
0x1000E|Clift: I wonder what my sister will do if I come alone...? Clift:
0x1000F|Keida
0x10010|Be a priest! A priest who serves God! I can't let my desires wash away.
0x10011|Minea: “That person?
0x10012|My friend disappeared in this room.
0x10013|
0x10014|It's a good thing to get in the way on the road.
0x10015|Manya: ``Why are you so excited? I'm getting paid, so it's no surprise that I'm being treated well.
0x10016|Manya: ``This is a place where only men come.
0x10017|Alina: “Hmm, what on earth are we doing here?
0x10018|What the hell! I want a princess to see a place like this
0x10019|Then I can't face the king!
0x1001A|Clift: Let's leave now. We can't bring the princess to such an indecent place.

0x101D2|Mr. Despisaro! ? ...No, it's okay if it's just a dream. I'll let you know. The Evil Priest says that he has reached the ultimate level of evolution. I don't know if that's true, but it's dangerous to underestimate it...
0x101D3|Evil Priest. I can't believe a word he says. If you were a monster with a heart, you wouldn't listen to the words of someone like that.
0x101D4|De…Despisaro-sama! ! ...I believed it. There's no way Despisaro-sama will die. Ugh...
0x101D5|It's the same no matter how many times you ask. I have no desire to serve the traitorous Evil Priest. If you want to kill him, tell the Evil Priest to kill him.
0x101D6|Do you know? Anyone who showed respect to Despizarro was put in jail. I never thought I'd be forced to watch over a monster in a prison. It's better than being eaten, but the gaze of the monster inside the prison is scary...

0x101D9|Yes! Yes! I'll prepare it right away, so I can't eat it!
0x101DA|Hmm, that's strange.... I wonder where the bones go when they eat them?
0x101DB|I'm hungry. I'm hungry.

0x102F5|Apparently, the monsters who were the king of the demons had died, and the monsters had been fighting each other for a while. You guys are in luck. Otherwise, there's no way you'll make it out of this castle alive.
0x102F6|De…Despisaro-sama! Welcome back! After all, it was a lie that he died!
0x102F7|No matter how many times I think about the fact that Despisaro-sama is dead, I just can't understand it! That Despisaro-sama would die... that kind of thing is impossible!
0x102F8|Despisaro-sama left for Attemto and will not be returning! I couldn't believe that something was happening to Emperor Estarch... No, that can't be true.
0x102F9|If so, I'll let you know. The Henge Wand is a magic wand that can change its appearance into anything. I heard that it rests in a royal tomb in the Endor region.

0x10329|Mr. Despisaro! I heard that he passed away, but that was a lie! Woohoo! This is going to be fun!
0x1032A|Lord Despisaro passed away and a revolution broke out in this castle! The Evil Priest's subordinates are in total chaos! It's not interesting at all.
0x1032B|Hmm, you're Despicaro! ? Stupid! I hear that Despisaro died at the end of the secret of evolution! Well, you're a fake!
0x1032C|Evil Priest is now ruling this castle in place of Despisaro!

0x1032E|This is the castle of us monsters, Death Palace!
0x1032F|It seems that Rosalie, the elf that Despisaro loved, was taken away by a stupid human. How angry would Despisaro be if he found out about this? ? Oh, it's scary just thinking about it...
0x10330|Emperor Estark has been resurrected from the ancient underground! If Despisaro-sama completes the secret method of evolution... even the god of the sky will no longer be able to touch him! Wahahaha!
0x10331|Hey, hey. Don't you think that humans are pathetic creatures who can't even fly? However, once upon a time, humans also flew in the sky using balloons.

0x104CD|I'm tired from working during the day. I don't want to hear any stupid stories about demon statues walking!
0x104CE|My people just say they're tired, tired, and don't listen at all.
0x104CF|Kuu~! Kii~! If there was a gas lighter than air, we could fly...
0x104D0|Even if we tried to ride a balloon, we would not be able to reach the sky far above the sky. However, if you travel around the world in a balloon, you might find your way to the sky.
0x104D1|According to an old book, all the vehicles that fly in the sky were built in hard pots...
0x104D2|I can't believe there's a castle in the sky high up in the sky.
0x104D3|I wonder if it's really possible to have a vehicle that flies in the sky...
0x104D4|Nyafu~n.
0x104D5|It was thanks to that gas pot that the balloon was completed. We will continue to work hard to make balloons! And one day, people all over the world will be able to travel freely through the skies... That is my dream.
0x104D6|Hey, you're here! The flying balloon is finally completed! ! The first issue will be presented to you. Please go outside!
0x104D7|thank you! As a thank you, please come to my house tomorrow. I'm sure you'll be able to give me something wonderful!
0x104D8|Please do it again. Could you hand over that pressure point to me?
0x104D9|thank you! As a thank you, please come to my house tomorrow. I'm sure you'll be able to give me something wonderful!
0x104DA|Is it okay to ask this much? Ugh... no one!
0x104DB|Somehow! please. For my research...
0x104DC|Wow! When I opened it, gas bubbled out from inside the pot! Maybe this is... I beg you. Could you hand over this pressure point to me?
0x104DD|Ugh. Isn't it nice to show it to you? It's not going to decrease....
0x104DE|Oh? Could you show me a little bit of that strange pressure point you have?
0x104DF|That's what I'd like to say, but in reality, it's still in the research stage and hasn't been completed yet. If there is a gas lighter than air, it should be possible to fly...
0x104E0|Hoho: Are you traveling around the world? Shall I sell you the flying vehicle I made?
0x104E1|Manya: ``It's kind of troublesome. I wish I could go quickly and easily without having to waste a lot of time.''
0x104E2|Clift: ``It seems like you can't go to the heavens, the kingdom of God, even with a balloon.
0x104E3|Ryan: ``Let's go around the world in a balloon, just like Sister said.'' Ryan: ``There's nothing wrong with what Sister says.
0x104E4|Bligh: ``I wonder what the origins of flying vehicles are? I'm a little curious.''
0x104E5|Clift: People often say I'm a hard guy, but I don't know what hard pressure points are.
0x104E6|Alina: “If I can throw a pot at all the pots in the world and it doesn’t fall, then I’m sure that’s the tough pot!
0x104E7|Ryan: If Sister says so, flying vehicles must have really existed.
0x104E8|Minea: But even that pressure point won't emit gas indefinitely... Minea: What will that scientist do if the gas comes out?
0x104E9|Manya: ``That's great. Everyone has one balloon in their family and anyone can fly.'' Manya: ``It seems fun just thinking about it.''
0x104EA|Torneko: ``That's a wonderful dream. At that time, I would love to use balloons in my shop for business.
0x104EB|Ryan: But flying technology can also be used in wars... Ryan: It's too much of a stretch to think that anyone will be able to use balloons.
0x104EC|Alina: It's wonderful to have your own dreams.My dream is to become the best martial artist in the world.Alina:Does <HERO> have any dreams that they would like to fulfill once peace is achieved?
0x104ED|Manya: "Eh! You meant a flying balloon!? That's a great present..." Manya: "But, a long time ago, I received a present from a fan of mine. It was a gift I didn't like flying. That means I'll continue to make balloons. Torneko: "When peace is restored, would you like me to sell some for my shop?
0x104EE|Bligh: Who is that scholar? You've finally completed your flying vehicle. Bligh: I've been thinking this is what you're going to do since I handed you that pot the other day!
0x104EF|Ryan: Balloon...is that the name of a flying vehicle? Ryan: Hmm. Just hearing the name makes it seem rather unreliable.
0x104F0|Arena: Hey <HERO>. Let's take a ride on that balloon right away!
0x104F1|Manya: What on earth are you going to give me as a present? Jewels? Or weapons and armor? Manya: Oh, I can't wait for tomorrow!
0x104F2|Toruneko: ``Was that pot by any chance worth something? Toruneko: According to my appraisal, it was nothing but junk...Hmm, I'm curious.
0x104F3|Bligh: Hmm. That scholar wanted it, so what's inside that pot? Bligh: I'd expect this to be a gift.
0x104F4|Ryan: ``There was some kind of strange gas inside that pot. What should we do with something like that?''
0x104F5|Panon: ``Maybe that was just a joke?'' Panon: ``If that's the case, that scholar is doing quite well!''
0x104F6|Bligh: It's a gas that's lighter than air... Even if something like that existed, how would you transport it?
0x104F7|Clift: What does lighter-than-air gas have to do with flight? Clift: It's completely incomprehensible to the average person what scientists think.
0x104F8|Alina: ``It looks like that scholar is really worried. Alina: I hope he doesn't worry so much that his hair doesn't fall out any more.
0x104F9|Ryan: Gas lighter than air? Does something like that really exist?
0x104FA|Bligh: It's a gas that's lighter than air... Even if something like that existed, how would you transport it?
0x104FB|Clift: What does lighter-than-air gas have to do with flight? Clift: It's completely incomprehensible to the average person what scientists think.
0x104FC|Ryan: It's all the fault of those academics that they had high hopes for it and then it wasn't completed in the end.
0x104FD|Manya: If we have a gas that is lighter than air, we can create a flying vehicle, right? Manya: Okay, <HERO>. Let's go find it right away!

0x107FB|Dozing off....
0x107FC|Nyafu~n.
0x107FD|Yay! I never expected to find this fishing spot! This is a secret spot only for me. Please leave others alone.
0x107FE|Meow.
0x107FF|Welcome to the river village of Riverside! Anyway, your ship is a great one. After all, ships traveling on the outside sea are different...
0x10800|It is said that there is a castle of monsters in the depths of this island. However, none of the people who went to check it came back...
0x10801|Long ago, people used vehicles to fly through the sky. However, it is said that the Emperor of Hell stole away all of the vehicles. Perhaps it was sealed underground along with the Emperor of Hell.
0x10802|Oh, I saw it! There's a big statue standing south of this river, and you can see where it's walking!
0x10803|If you go south from here, you will see a demon statue.
0x10804|Pissarro: ``That monster's castle... it's probably waiting for me in Death Palace.'' Pissarro: ``Then I have to go there.
0x10805|Alina: ``The monster's castle wasn't much of a surprise.'' Alina: ``Ah. When will I be able to show my true power?
0x10806|Ryan: Since we returned safely, I would like you to correct Sister's words.
0x10807|Torneko: ``It made me bold to sneak into a monster's castle disguised as a monster.'' Torneko: ``This is definitely the influence of <HERO>s, too.
0x10808|Minea: "What happened to those who didn't come back? After all, they're already..." Minea: "I wish we could somehow find out if they were alive or dead...
0x10809|Manya: How do you know there's a monster castle when no one has returned? Manya: Isn't that sister exaggerating a bit?
0x1080A|Bligh: If that's a monster's hideout, then you'll have to be aware of some risks before going there. Bligh: Maybe you'll find out why our people disappeared.
0x1080B|Clift: ``Princess. Riding into a monster's castle is extremely dangerous. Clift: I won't stop you now, but please, in that case, please take Clift with you.''
0x1080C|Arena: How wonderful would a monster's castle be! Arena: Maybe there, I could demonstrate my true power with my masterful arm...
0x1080D|Torneko: ``We have defeated the Emperor of Hell.'' Torneko: ``Well, it's been an absolutely incredible journey.
0x1080E|Clift: ``The reason humans don't have wings is because God created them that way.'' Clift: ``But I'm sure God would allow people to fly in order to save the world.''
0x1080F|Alina: "Didn't that person see us flying in a balloon?
0x10810|Ryan: So the contents of the gas pot were the source of what that poet was talking about. Ryan: I see. Legends are things you can't make fun of.
0x10811|Manya: "A flying vehicle? I'm sure it would feel great to look down at the ground from high up in the sky. Manya: "Hmm. When I imagined it, I wanted to ride it no matter what!
0x10812|Torneko: "Hmm. If we could fly, we would be able to transport the goods we purchased much faster. Torneko: This would also revolutionize the world of commerce. We really need to bring it back!
0x10813|Bligh: Flying vehicles are wonderful! Bligh: It's a shame that such technology has been lost. Forgive me, Emperor of Hell!
0x10814|Clift: ``The reason humans don't have wings is because God made them that way.'' Clift: ``Then, does it go against God's will to fly as a human?''
0x10815|Ryan: It's impossible for people to fly in the sky, but when it involves the Emperor of Hell, it rings true.Ryan: Well, the truth is literally in the darkness, deep down in the depths of the earth.
0x10816|Minea: If you had asked the priest at the foot of that statue, he would have known right away that the statue was moving...
0x10817|Bly: But who besides us moved that colossus? Bly: What if a monster was using it for transportation? That's a rather funny sight.
0x10818|Ryan: ``I guess what that lady said was true.'' Ryan: ``Honestly, I'm ashamed of myself for pretending to sing.
0x10819|Manya: It's not normal for elephants to be big or walk! Manya: Huh? A big statue?...Ugh, that's noisy! I just blurted it out!
0x1081A|Torneko: ``I can't believe that the giant statue is moving.''
0x1081B|Clift: ``Stupid things like moving statues...'' Clift: ``But I can't believe he's lying.'' Am I wrong?
0x1081C|Ryan: ``The statue walked? Hahaha. That's stupid! Ryan: ``That lady must have had a dream.''
0x1081D|Alina: ``It sounds interesting that the statue moves. Alina: Hey <HERO>. Let's go see that big statue right away!
0x1081E|Lucia: ``Wow! There are villages on both sides of the river. That's interesting.
0x1081F|Panon: At Riverside, I was discouraged from doing my best by a kind person. Panon: ``...Ugh, I'm in a slump.
0x10820|Minea: I feel a strong presence of monsters on this continent, but people still live in places like this.
0x10821|Manya: Don't the people here have any idea about building bridges over rivers? Manya: It's not just a hassle to cross the river every time by boat.
0x10822|Torneko: ``Looking at it from the outside, I had no idea there was a village here.'' Toruneko: ``Even if there's nothing at first glance, when you actually go there yourself, you'll often find something unexpected. Torneko: ``This also applies to business.
0x10823|Clift: ``Wouldn't it be inconvenient for the people who live in the village to be split between the two banks?
0x10824|Alina: ``It's so interesting to be able to enter the village while on a ship!
0x10825|Ryan: ``I had no idea there was a village in a place like this.It's a new discovery for me.
0x10826|Torneko: Mr. Bly. It's not our ship, it's mine. Just in case.
0x10827|Bligh: Hmm. It seems that the villagers here go back and forth between the two banks by boat. Bligh: Well, it's a small boat that can't even compare to ours. Fofofo.
0x10828|I never thought we'd be able to fly a flying vehicle. That teacher was great
0x10829|Yes!
0x1082A|A scholar who lives on the opposite shore is trying to create a flying vehicle that existed a long time ago.
0x1082B|But I wonder if it's possible to do something like that? I can't believe it.
0x1082C|Manya: Is it a flying vehicle? It must feel good to look down at the ground from high up in the sky.
0x1082D|Manya: “Hmm. What if I imagined it?
0x1082E|I want to ride it!
0x1082F|Torneko: Research into flying vehicles sounds interesting. Could it be used for commercial purposes?
0x10830|Clift: The reason humans don't have wings is because God created them like.
0x10831|Clift: So, does it mean that flying in the sky as a human is against God's will?
0x10832|Ryan: ``It's hard to believe that something like a flying vehicle is happening all of a sudden.
0x10833|i can't believe.

0x10B46|I don't sleep during work!
0x10B47|Minea: ``I definitely saw that person sleeping.'' Minea: ``Not only do you slack off, but you also lie and cheat, just like your sister!
0x10B48|Manya: ``Well, everyone has times when they feel like slacking off, so isn't that okay? Manya: ``It's too bad that you're blaming me for something like that.''...I'm so kind.
0x10B49|Torneko: "Well, there aren't many guests at the inn in this village, so I can understand that you have a lot of free time..." Torneko: "However, it would be a problem if the guests saw you slacking off.
0x10B4A|Alina: ``That move you just made was pretty quick.'' Alina: ``If he can move that much, he'll definitely become stronger.
0x10B4B|Bligh: "Absolutely! I don't think it's outrageous that you're sleeping in a bed meant for guests! Bligh: Now, <HERO>, let's go. We'll never stay in an inn like this!
0x10B4C|King: “Goooooooo.
0x10B4D|Thank you very much for the padekia seeds. With this, this country will become great!
0x10B4E|You are the God of salvation! Now this country belongs to you too!
0x10B4F|? Padekia seeds? Well, how happy the king would be to hear that! But now I'm tired and I'm falling asleep. Please come first tomorrow!
0x10B50|The king is a very fine man. But after Padekia was wiped out, no matter how hard I worked, this country wouldn't get any better. Poor king...
0x10B51|King: “Grrrr….
0x10B52|Monsters in the cave! Mummy...
0x10B53|Grrrr...
0x10B54|Grrrr... Just being able to stay out of the rain like this makes us happy.
0x10B55|vinegar
0x10B56|vinegar
0x10B57|…….
0x10B58|The king is a very fine man. But after Padekia was wiped out, no matter how hard I worked, this country wouldn't get any better. Poor king...
0x10B59|Have you come to see the king? But my king is out at work. This is just a story, but this country is so bad that the king himself has to work.
0x10B5A|This is King Soretta's room.
0x10B5B|Minea: “I wonder which one is louder, my sister’s snoring….
0x10B5C|Bligh: Looks like Clift's stupid illness wasn't in vain. Hmm. Well, I guess that's fine.
0x10B5D|Alina: Where did the three men you took with you in the cave go after that? Alina: They were slow. I left them somewhere on the way back to Mintos.
0x10B5E|Bligh: Hohoho. It's amazing to hear people's gratitude! It makes me feel good.
0x10B5F|Clift: “You all are the God of salvation for me as well. Thank you so much.
0x10B60|Manya: If I were to call myself a god, I'd want something like Osaisen. Just 10G would be fine.
0x10B61|Manya: ``I'm sleepy as hell, too.'' Hey, let's take a break today.
0x10B62|Bligh
0x10B63|If there were monsters in the cave, there was no way the princess would be hiding there. Bly: “Anyway.
0x10B64|Let's hurry to the cave!
0x10B65|Torneko: ``I remember that. I was like that too when I was young.''
0x10B66|- That's embarrassing.
0x10B67|Manya: “You have to be a little more handsome to say things like that. A man’s face comes first! Otherwise, it’s all about the money!”
0x10B68|Manya: “What, Minea? Did you say something?
0x10B69|Minea: King Soretta is quite respected by the people. Minea: A person who works properly is more honorable than someone who just plays around. Of course.
0x10B6A|Bligh: It's quite a sight to see that the king and the people are of one mind, even though they are poor. Bligh: Hmm. Maybe the country of Soretta will become a big country someday.
0x10B6B|Manya: ``...There are many different types of castles.
0x10B6C|Atatatata! I was stung by a numb jellyfish!
0x10B6D|King: Good luck Padekia! Now I can take more responsibility for my work than ever before! Wahahaha!
0x10B6E|Welcome to Soretta's castle! Now, please go inside.
0x10B6F|I've been in the field for 30 years! From now on, I'll do my best to grow Padekia. That's it!
0x10B70|Umo Umomo!
0x10B71|The cows Yukki and Ira are great friends. Hey Yukki.
0x10B72|Hey! Do you have padekia seeds? What a waste!
0x10B73|This is Soretta country. It's a specialty of Padekia that can cure any disease!
0x10B74|This is Soletta's castle. But the king has already said goodnight.
0x10B75|Fishing is limited to night fishing. I didn't manage to catch an octopus the other day. No, it's true!
0x10B76|Mummy... Yukki Hayagu, get big...Mnya.
0x10B77|King: ``Thank you! This country is now saved!'' King: ``Sasa, you too should take the roots of Padekia with you.
0x10B78|Oh my God! Before long, padekia sprouted!
0x10B79|{7f4c} sowed padekia seeds in the field!
0x10B7A|oh! Ooooo! That is exactly the padekia seed! Finally finally... Let's quickly put those seeds in the fields of the village! Don't worry, padekia will grow quickly.
0x10B7B|King: ``I'm the king of this country! It's already sad since our padekia were wiped out.'' King: ``I heard that the previous king kept padekia seeds in a cave in the south just in case...'' King: ``Since when did the caves have been inhabited by demons, and our soldiers couldn't stop them?'' King: ``I'm sorry. As long as you have padekia seeds, your wishes can be fulfilled.'' I don't care if it comes true.
0x10B7C|Boommoommo!
0x10B7D|Welcome to Soretta's castle! Now, please go inside.
0x10B7E|Myooo.
0x10B7F|Hoho: Did it come from Mintos? My daughter followed me to that town. I have two cute grandchildren. I hope you're doing well....
0x10B80|I've been in the field for 30 years! Huh? Padekia root? Ah, that was wiped out in the drought five years ago. So now I'm growing carrots and radish.
0x10B81|Umo!
0x10B82|Really Yukki. You and I can see your faces reflected in the pond!
0x10B83|No reply.... It looks like just a scarecrow.
0x10B84|Are you looking for someone? Come to think of it, Alina's daughter came the other day. Alone? Yeah nya. It must have been tough, or it must have been damaged, but it was accompanied by about three men.
0x10B85|This is Soretta country. It's a specialty of Padekia, which can cure any illness. That's because it's a long time ago.
0x10B86|Boo boo!
0x10B87|Panon: ``I met you at Soletta, Lalala, and I fell in love with you.'' Panon: ``That was my first love, Lalala.'' Panon: ``How do you like it? I think I'll be good at singing.
0x10B88|Ryan: “Huh? What kind of business do you have in a country town like this?
0x10B89|Bligh: ``Wow, there you go. I've been getting better at night than this year. Why don't you take a break soon?''
0x10B8A|Clift: I guess everyone is already on vacation, isn't it? I'm not too happy...
0x10B8B|Alina: ``Hey, look at that sky! The stars are so beautiful. Wow, I can see so many!'' Alina: ``You can see so many stars when there's not much light in the house. I didn't know that.
0x10B8C|Torneko: ``Why don't we take a break at the inn? Everyone seems tired.
0x10B8D|Minea: “I love dark and quiet places like this. Hehehe….
0x10B8E|Manya: ``Because it's an empty village, my shining beauty is even more striking.'' Manya: ``Uh huh. Sometimes it's nice to be in the countryside.''
0x10B8F|Ryan: ``The king himself is rinsing in the fields, rinsing, rinsing, sloping on me.'' Torneko: ``The king here is really a good man, isn't he? He's great at working on his own.'' Torneko: ``Both Endor and Bonmor, when you call them kings, they just give orders to people, and it's been a lot of hard work for them.
0x10B90|Alina: ``When I was looking at King Soretta, I remembered my father. I wonder if he's okay.''
0x10B91|Minea: “I hope this Soretta country will become rich soon.
0x10B92|Alina: ``At that time, we were completely ahead of ourselves.It was frustrating.
0x10B93|Manya: ``Oh no, that old man! He's staring at me with naughty eyes. I wonder if I'll give him an iron fan.''
0x10B94|Alina: ``It really took a lot of effort to get Padekia.'' Alina: ``...What?! I wasn't the one who found the seeds though.
0x10B95|Lucia: The smell of pigs and cows is quite...sick.
0x10B96|Bligh: Since Padekia has returned, people's faces seem to be glowing. No, quite a bit.
0x10B97|Clift: ``Sigh...'' I was so pathetic that I apologized to the princess. Clift: ``I have to calm down a little.''
0x10B98|Alina: ``People in this country have pretty good bodies. Maybe it's because they work in the fields?
0x10B99|Torneko: “Wow, everyone in this country should work hard! That’s wonderful!
0x10B9A|Minea: ``The sun is bright, the sea is beautiful...It's a nice, quiet village.''
0x10B9B|Manya: ``Oh, the neon lights! I miss the smell of alcohol at the bar. No, that's me. It doesn't suit my personality.
0x10B9C|Manya: ``Hmm, it's still idyllic and plain, but it's not my kind of gala.
0x10B9D|Bligh: Wow, that was a lot of work. But I finally got the Padekia root. Bligh: Now, let's hurry back to Mintos and do some good to Clift's idiot!
0x10B9E|Torneko: ``I would like to carry that Padekia in my store someday.I'm sure it will sell well.''
0x10B9F|Minea: ``From now on, the people of Soretta won't have to suffer too much. I'm so glad!
0x10BA0|Manya: ``It's not like I'm working every day. The King is amazing! Manya: ``As far as I can see, there's padekia everywhere. Wow, I wonder how much it's going to cost.''
0x10BA1|Bligh: No matter where they go, idiot merchants only say stupid things. No, they don't say it, they say it.
0x10BA2|Bligh: Is this still a country? It can't compare to my Santheim.
0x10BA3|Bligh: Normally, I wouldn't have any business to do in the countryside like this, but it can't be helped. Bligh: Now, where is the princess?
0x10BA4|Torneko: I wonder if I could sell some of the things that are popular in Endor...
0x10BA5|Minea: “I love dark and quiet places like this. Hehehe….
0x10BA6|Manya: ``Because it's an empty village, my shining beauty is even more striking.'' Manya: ``Uh huh. Sometimes it's nice to be in the countryside.''
0x10BA7|Manya: Isn't this really just a field? You can't even see the lights of the house.
0x10BA8|Bligh: ``When I heard that there was a monster in the cave, I could see the joy on the princess's face. Wow, that's it! Bligh: In any case, Padekia and the princess should be in the cave as well. Come on, let's go there too!
0x10BA9|Toruneko: ``Those who don't work shouldn't eat! This is my theory.'' Toruneko: ``But if I had eaten as much as I worked every day, I would have ended up like this.''
0x10BAA|Manya: I'm sure there's more than just padekia seeds in the cave in the south, there's also treasure! Manya: That said, it's a country where even the king works in the fields. It's a little intimidating.
0x10BAB|Bligh: My castle in Santheim is a three-story building, and it's a beautiful building. Hohoho. Bligh: No, I'm not bragging about it at all. It's just a memory.
0x10BAC|Minea: “...A castle? Is this hut...?
0x10BAD|Manya: “Ah. I know, I know. As expected, girls want to go to a big city like Mintos.
0x10BAE|Bligh: It can't be called a panacea if it's not there when you need it!...Hmm. What should I do?
0x10BAF|Minea: Padekia was supporting this country, but everyone is having a hard time.
0x10BB0|Torneko: "He's exactly the same age as my son. He's so cute.
0x10BB1|Manya: “I guess I’ll be looking forward to it in 10 years.
0x10BB2|Bligh: It's a disgrace to the Santheim royal family to carry around idiots who don't even know what horse bones they are! Bligh: We need to hurry up and find the princess and bring her back!!
0x10BB3|Manya: ``You're dragging three men with you!? How jealous!'' Manya: ``That's right.Both men and women are weak when it comes to titles.Ah, I wish I was born a princess!
0x10BB4|Bligh: "Hmm. Then you're talking about the short-tempered princess. She's already in this village... no, the country. Bly: Anyway, let's listen to her story a little more.
0x10BB5|Torneko: ``There are risks like this when you focus on only the most popular products. It's dangerous, it's dangerous.
0x10BB6|Minea: From what I can see, there are no medicinal herbs that resemble Padekia growing anywhere... Minea: What on earth happened in the country of Soletta?
0x10BB7|Torneko: "Why are you looking at me? Torneko: Well, your stomach is sticking out, but it's not that round yet! I am!!
0x10BB8|Manya: How about roasted pig for dinner tonight? Cow would be fine too!
0x10BB9|Bligh: ``This is what we call a country. It can't be compared to my Santheim.
0x10BBA|Bligh: Normally, I wouldn't have any business to do in the countryside like this, but it can't be helped. Bligh: Now, where is the princess?
0x10BBB|Torneko: ``The air is so clean. Come on, let's take a deep breath together!
0x10BBC|Minea: ``The sun is bright, the sea is beautiful...It's a nice, quiet village.''
0x10BBD|Manya: ``Oh, neon lights! I hear the sound of alcohol at the bar. That's me in the arena. It doesn't suit my personality.
0x10BBE|Manya: ``It's a beautiful, bright rural village that's rare these days. Wow, it's so fresh. Manya: ``...I thought so, but it's not just cows, pigs, horses, and fields.'' I'll be done with it in five minutes.
0x10BBF|I'm sure the princess had the thief's key. ...Did you really want to kick the door open that much? Oh well. Let's go!
0x10BC0|Alina: ``Okay, the door is open. Let's go, everyone!
0x10BC1|Alina: “Hey!!
0x10BC2|Alina: “Oh, this door is locked. …Alright!
0x10BC3|Alina: This is the cave where Padekia seeds are found!
0x10BC4|Lucia: "I'm so cold that I can't do it anymore..." Lucia: "Oh, I can see...I can see... my friends from the castle in the sky are coming to pick me up.
0x10BC5|Panon: "Wow, it's cold. The walls and the floor are covered in ice. It's so cold in a place like this!
0x10BC6|Ryan: "You're a warrior. No matter if it's hot or cold, you have to give your best no matter where you are." Ryan: "But it gets really cold in this cave...
0x10BC7|Bligh: ``It seems like the princess thought she could find Padekia on her own, but that's naive! Bligh: You must have realized that having someone like Bligh to depend on is what you need after all. Hohoho.
0x10BC8|Clift: ``I can't believe I sent the princess to such a cold, dark, and dangerous cave...'' Clift: ``Oh, I feel so pathetic. If there was a hole, I'd want to go in there.''
0x10BC9|Alina: ``Last time I came to this cave, I was able to explore freely and it was fun. No one was noisy! Alina: ``Hmm, I'd like to travel alone someday.
0x10BCA|Toruneko: ``A frozen, mysterious world of sparkling ice. Ice cave tour!'' Toruneko: ``I'm sure the ladies will like this.''
0x10BCB|Minea: ``I'm using this ice, but ice melts, right?'' Minea: ``It's more expensive, but crystal is more convenient.I thought it was a good idea.''
0x10BCC|Manya: ``It's so cold! Hey, we don't need anything anymore, right? Let's go outside quickly.''
0x10BCD|Bligh: ``A natural maze that uses ice. I've put a lot of thought into it. This... it's going to be great! Bligh: When it gets cold like this, my body starts to hurt. Heh, heh, heck!
0x10BCE|Minea: "This wall of ice. It looks like it could be used in place of a crystal ball.
0x10BCF|Manya: ``When the ground is frozen, it's slippery and you don't like it.And it's so fast!
0x10BD0|Manya: ``No, no! It's cold like this! I'm getting sensitive to cold.'' Manya: ``I want to go back to the inn quickly and get in the warm room! Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu than than!
0x10BD1|Bligh: Why does the princess try to solve everything by force? Oh, that's embarrassing.
0x10BD2|Manya: “That girl... I think she was called a princess, right? Is that really a princess?
0x10BD3|Hoffman: Cave exploration? Hmm, I'd rather go to the town of Mintos.
0x10BD4|Minea: ``This is the first time I've seen a cave made of ice...It's beautiful.''
0x10BD5|Manya: “Come on, come on!! Hey, what’s going on here? Let’s get out!
0x10BD6|Princess Alina, who is at the front, has also joined us. I helped her... no, she helped me to reach this cave.
0x10BD7|We are on a journey to save this world from the Emperor of Hell.
0x10BD8|Hey, it's nice to see you again. Don't you remember? We met at Blanca's castle, right? At that time, I had so many friends that I couldn't make them friends, so I'm sorry.
0x10BD9|Alina: "Oh! Isn't it Bligh!? Alina: Is Clift okay? What on earth happened to make you come this far? Alina: There's no need to worry. Alina: We'll find the padekia seeds. I'll save Clift!
0x10BDA|Alina: ``Oh! It's not Bligh!? Alina: What's wrong with you? How did you come to a place like this? Alina: Huh? Join that person and get the padekia seeds too? Alina: Hmm. They seem weak. There's no need to worry. Alina: We'll find the padekia seeds. I'll save Clift!
0x10BDB|Alina: ``Maybe you want padekia too? But I'm sorry.'' Alina: ``We'll take the padekia seeds!''
0x10BDC|Lucia: "I'm so cold that I can't do it anymore..." Lucia: "Oh, I can see...I can see... my friends from the castle in the sky are coming to pick me up.
0x10BDD|Panon: "Wow, it's cold. The walls and the floor are covered in ice. It's so cold in a place like this!

0x10BE3|Minea: ``I thought of a new fortune-telling method using this ice, but ice melts, right?'' Minea: ``It's more expensive, but crystal is more convenient. I thought it was a good idea.''
0x10BE4|Manya: ``It's so cold! Hey, we don't need anything anymore, right? Let's go outside quickly.''

0x10BE6|Manya: “Wow, that princess seems to be quite strong. I wish she were a man.”
0x10BE7|Minea: Could it be that those people received the same guidance as us? Minea: But they seem quite weak. Maybe it's just my imagination.
0x10BE8|Bligh: You stupid guy who seems to have hurt you. If you do something to the princess, you won't get away with it for free!
0x10BE9|Manya: ``Unfortunately, I don't remember your plain face. Did you meet that person somewhere?
0x10BEA|Bligh: I'm glad the princess is safe, but what are those men like!? Bligh: If this happens, we need to find Padekia as soon as possible and chase them away!!
0x10BEB|Minea: How can I say this... I sense the same smell in Mr. Bly as I do. Minea: The smell of a friend who has lived a life surrounded by easy-going people.
0x10BEC|Minea: Isn't that the princess who kicked the door open? Minea: ...She doesn't even have legs like that. That's amazing.
0x10BED|What! Clift isn't hungry! He's on fire!
0x10BEE|Bligh: ``A natural maze that uses ice. I've put a lot of thought into it. This... it's going to be great! Bligh: When it gets cold like this, my body starts to hurt. Heh, heh, heck!
0x10BEF|Minea: "This wall of ice. It looks like it could be used in place of a crystal ball.
0x10BF0|Manya: ``When the ground is frozen, it's slippery and you don't like it.And it's so fast!
0x10BF1|Manya: ``No, no! It's cold like this! I'm getting sensitive to cold.'' Manya: ``I want to go back to the inn quickly and get in the warm room! Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu than than!

0x10C01|I'm sure you would have realized this if you had asked for something like this. Hohohoho.

0x10C03|Zenkihime
0x10C04|What can I do? Clift: “Oh, I feel so pathetic. If there’s a hole, I’ll go in.”

0x10C14|Lucia: I'm so cold, I can't do it anymore... Lucia: Ah, I can see... I can see... My friends from the castle in the sky are picking me up and wrapping me up in ice. It's getting cold. The walls and floor are covered in ice. It's already freezing in this cold place!
0x10C15|Ryan: "You're a warrior. No matter if it's hot or cold, you have to give your best no matter where you are." Ryan: "But it gets really cold in this cave...
0x10C16|Bligh: ``It seems like the princess thought she could find Padekia on her own, but that's naive! Bligh: You must have realized that having someone like Bligh to depend on is what you need after all. Hohoho.
0x10C17|Clift: ``I can't believe I sent the princess to such a cold, dark, and dangerous cave...'' Clift: ``Oh, I feel so pathetic. If there was a hole, I'd want to go in there.''

0x10C1A|Minea: ``I thought of a new fortune-telling method using this ice, but ice melts, right?'' Minea: ``It's more expensive, but crystal is more convenient. I thought it was a good idea.''
0x10C1B|Manya: ``It's so cold! Hey, we don't need anything anymore, right? Let's go outside quickly.''
0x10C1C|Bligh: Hmm! This will save the princess from getting upset! Bligh: Now, we have to fix Clift's stupidity. Let's go outside quickly!
0x10C1D|Manya: ``Yay! Look! Now I can finally take a warm bath.''
0x10C1E|Bligh: Oh, this is... it's so cold! It's the deepest part of the cave... it's so deep! It's like... Bligh: Ugh, but it's getting cold.

0x10F56|I'm going
0x10F57|
0x10F58|There is an old book that says ``In Search of the Magic Wand, Chapter 4.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. I am the wizard Madrue. Although I didn't feel like it, I decided to take this as part of my job and crawl into the cave. It is said that in order to find the magic wand, you should look at the bottom of the deepest treasure chest... The innermost room must have been very carefully designed. Do you hate me that much? Muki~! ! ...No, I was a little distraught. Anyway, once I find this magic wand, I'll stop doing this kind of work. I'm going to go back to my hometown and start some kind of business with the money I've been working hard to save. From now on, I'll live my life as I please!
0x10F59|Torneko: "Hmm... I see, this is a material I've never seen before. This key is a valuable item. Torneko: Oops. Just because of that doesn't mean you can't sell it.
0x10F5A|Clift: If we have this key, a new path may be born for us.
0x10F5B|Minea: “Thank you. Dad….
0x10F5C|Manya: “Yes, there is! My father is really good at teasing me.”
0x10F5D|Manya: ``I can't believe that my father had a room like this without even letting us know...'' Manya: ``I can't believe he was doing other things besides research.'' It's about your father.
0x10F5E|Minea: “I didn’t know. The room that my father used….
0x10F5F|Manya: ``Ah, haha.'' My father looked at me with a smile on his face, and said, ``I'm sure you hit the target of the dummies''...
0x10F60|Manya: ``Ah... I feel sorry for myself for being in this cave again...''
0x10F61|Minea: There must be a reason why Mr. Orin was in this depths. Minea: There's still something in this cave. There's no doubt about it.
0x10F62|Arena: ``Okay! No matter what kind of monster appears, this arena will deal with it!
0x10F63|Lucia: ``I'm always up in the sky, so being under the ground is quite exciting and wonderful.
0x10F64|Bligh: ``There's a sign of a monster. In any case, don't let your guard down.
0x10F65|Manya: ``Ah... I feel sorry for myself for being in this cave again...''
0x10F66|Minea: There must be a reason why Mr. Orin was in this depths. Minea: There's still something in this cave. There's no doubt about it.
0x10F67|Arena: ``Okay! No matter what kind of monster appears, this arena will deal with it!
0x10F68|Lucia: ``I'm always up in the sky, so being under the ground is quite exciting and wonderful.

0x10F6C|Minea: “Mr. Orin is like this.
0x10F6D|There must be a reason why he was there. Minea: There's still something in this cave. There's no doubt about it.
0x10F6E|Arena: ``Okay! No matter what kind of monster appears, this arena will deal with it!
0x10F6F|Lucia: ``I'm always up in the sky, so being under the ground is quite exciting and wonderful.
0x10F70|Bligh: ``There's a monster in the way. In any case, don't let your guard down.
0x10F71|Manya: “Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa…. I feel sorry for you, Manya, for lying again.
0x10F72|Minea: There must be a reason why Mr. Orin was in the back. Minea: There's still something to this lie. There's no doubt about it.
0x10F73|Manya: “Manya is so bright and cheerful when she comes down to the floor below.”
0x10F74|It's because I don't have enough energy. Manya: ``...I wonder if I'll do the same thing with Arena and Manya...
0x10F75|Nate
0x10F76|Forbidden Manya, come on, that monster
0x10F77|Even if you fail, this arena will be your opponent!

0x10F7C|Please don't bully me. I'm not a bad slime. Ah, that's right! Mr. Edgan also had a secret laboratory in addition to this one! I think it's inside the western cave! I think you'll find the magic key if you go there.
0x10F7D|Manya: “That slime has completely settled here.
0x10F7E|Manya: I went to the West Cave before, but was there anything like that?
0x10F7F|Minea: Dad's secret laboratory? Minea: This is the first time I've heard of such a thing. There's a place like that in the western cave...
0x10F80|Clift: “It was a very friendly slime.
0x10F81|Manya: Minea, hurry up. You'll only feel sad if you stay here.
0x10F82|Minea: Sister... Do you still remember that day? Minea: I guess... I'll never forget it.
0x10F83|Minea: ``......'' Minea: ``It's like time has stopped here, just like that day...''
0x10F84|Kokkuri Kokkuri....
0x10F85|Grrrr...
0x10F86|picture? Magic key? Come to think of it, Mr. Edgan's student, Mr. Orin, had something like that.
0x10F87|He was alive. That was good.
0x10F88|Minea-chan!
0x10F89|Manya!
0x10F8A|Alina: ``It's okay! Even if you don't have the key, everything will be fine!'' Alina: ``As long as I'm here, there won't be a problem with a door or two!
0x10F8B|Bly: Hmm. I'd like to somehow get my hands on that key.
0x10F8C|Minea: Mr. Orin... I guess there's nothing we can do about it now...
0x10F8D|Manya: Wow! Isn't this a rather shocking fact? Manya: Even though Orin had a magic key, he was breaking open the door!
0x10F8E|Pesta: “Kun kun.
0x10F8F|Heheen!
0x10F90|Heheen!
0x10F91|Nmooooo.
0x10F92|Ever since King Leo took over, tax collection has become stricter. I have to work until this late night. The previous king, who died, would not have allowed something like this to happen. Grumbling...
0x10F93|Oh my, have you gotten used to Pesta the dog? Or maybe you smell like slime. Did you talk to a slime recently? Well, either way is fine.
0x10F94|Pesta: “Wan, wan, wan!
0x10F95|I saw a slime in the village! Pesta the dog is also looking for him and barking.
0x10F96|Heheen!
0x10F97|Heheen!
0x10F98|Alchemist Edgan was killed trying to erase the secret of evolution! Evolution means monkeys evolving into humans, right? But what will happen if humans evolve further?
0x10F99|Nmooooo.
0x10F9A|This is Komiz village. Oh, I'm sure you're Edgan-san's daughter! That's right, you're back!
0x10F9B|This is Komiz village.
0x10F9C|It is engraved with the words ``Alchemist Edgan Rests Here''.
0x10F9D|Alchemist Edgan's house.
0x10F9E|Minea: ``I'm sorry, Pesta. I still have a little more to do.'' Minea: ``I'll come back when that's done... Then we can live together again.'' Minea: ``I'm sorry, Pesta.
0x10F9F|Minea: Sorry, Pesta. After I defeat my father, Kataki, then we can live together again.
0x10FA0|Minea: Pesta, you remember us well!
0x10FA1|Torneko: ``The secret of evolution...'' I also heard those words during my travels.
0x10FA2|Minea: When I saw Balzac, I realized that my father wasn't wrong. Minea: If we don't erase the secret of evolution, someone will definitely be unhappy...
0x10FA3|Manya: ``Calvin the cow still seems to be doing well.'' Manya: ``Since I was a child, I've decided that I'm definitely going to eat that guy someday.''
0x10FA4|Minea: “Hehe. I’m glad that everyone hasn’t changed.
0x10FA5|Panon: ``What a strange thing to go to Komiz Village by yourself... It's a sleep-making technique.
0x10FA6|Renzuo can go! I'll leave it there!
0x10FA7|Manya: ``It's as serious as ever, and nothing has changed in this village.
0x10FA8|Minea: ``I never thought I'd be able to come back here alive again...''
0x10FA9|Torneko: ``It's a peaceful and nice village. Is this Manya's hometown?
0x10FAA|Is that so? I'll be careful.
0x10FAB|good morning. I'll be careful.
0x10FAC|Well then, have a good night's sleep.
0x10FAD|I can't take money from you guys in this village. It's okay if it's free. Do you want to take a rest?
0x10FAE|She's Edgan's daughter!
0x10FAF|I'm a traveling merchant. Come to think of it, I heard rumors that a new town has been built in the place where the desert bazaar used to be. I'd like to go and see what kind of town it is, but that's aside...
0x10FB0|I'm a traveling merchant. Until recently, I was holding a desert bazaar in the country of Santheim, but that has come to an end. I'm about to go south to Montbarbara. Now! Now that I can see you all, let's do some business!

0x112B0|Masu…….
0x112B1|No reply. It looks like it's just a piece of paper... However, a letter is clutched in his hand.
0x112B2|Meow...
0x112B3|My friends did something amazing! But then suddenly the monsters
0x112B4|hand……. Gohogoho.
0x112B5|Oh God! It seems that the time of destruction has finally come.
0x112B6|This is the mining town of Atemt. But that's all over now. You guys, hurry up and run away!

0x112BA|Meow...
0x112BB|There's a strange gas coming out of the coal mine.
0x112BC|A person fell down with a flop. It's all over here.
0x112BD|This is the mining town of Atemt. That said, it's not really a place where people can live now. The person at the grave here has finally gone to be with his deceased wife...
0x112BE|It is engraved with the words, ``Forever be the souls of the brave men of the mines.''
0x112BF|It is engraved with the words ``Here lies my beloved Helen.''

0x112C6|This is so frustrating, I will definitely defeat Estark!
0x112C7|Manya: Sigh... Estark is inside the mine, right? Manya: That means we have to go inside that mine again...
0x112C8|Toruneko: "No matter how hard we try, there's still a town like this..." Toruneko: "I feel like I can't be saved...I was like, oh my God! If we stay too long, we'll be close to death.
0x112C9|Clift: “Like this

0x112D7|Bligh: ``There's gas like this coming out from underground.
0x112D8|Sumeno. It's possible. Bligh: I hope it's not the power of some crazy person.
0x112D9|Bligh: The mining town of Attemt... The name of this town came from King Santheim.
0x112DA|Sumeno. There is. Bligh: You said we had to stop the mines, but what was that for?
0x112DB|Clift: ``Let us offer our blessings to those who have been called to heaven...''
0x112DC|Manya: “Me and Minea came earlier.
0x112DD|The number of people has decreased even more. Manya: ``This kind of thing is a bit of a shock.
0x112DE|Panon: What on earth is going on with gas coming out from underground!? Panon: It doesn't seem like we're in a situation where we can say something like that. Excuse me.
0x112DF|Hoffman: ``I can't believe that there is a town that is suffering so much...'' Hoffman: ``No, let's believe it. Everything that we see is reality.''

0x112E6|Minea: There's still gas here.
0x112E7|It's so cool...
0x112E8|My grandfather's only purpose in life was making gunpowder, but he was forbidden to do that. Since then, I have completely lost my energy...
0x112E9|Goho, goho…. Tomorrow I'll be alive...
0x112EA|Manya: ``My current grandfather must have been an expert at making gunpowder. Manya: ``But he seems to have been quite lethargic.

0x112F8|Na.
0x112F9|Minea:
0x112FA|It was. Inside the mine, not only gas but also monsters come out.

0x11797|Tell this person about <TOWN>
0x11798|?
0x11799|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x1179A|Hey, welcome, welcome! Have a fun night drinking and singing!
0x1179B|Ah, I'm busy. Everyone drinks so much that it's hard to take orders.
0x1179C|Apparently, a princess from a castle somewhere won the martial arts tournament held in Endor. But when the princess returned to her castle after the match, she found it completely empty. There are some strange things.
0x1179D|King Leo's King Balzac has been seen less than ever before. Thanks to this, I am able to spread my wings. Yay. Hiccup.
0x1179E|Jill-chan is such a dick. Brother, it's a waste. I'll make it your favorite!
0x1179F|Jill: ``I'm Jill. Come on, you guys, dance, dance!
0x117A0|Hey! Have you had any alcohol yet? Alcohol!
0x117A1|I'm still preparing. I'm sorry.
0x117A2|I'm Jill. Thank you for coming to see me so early. Jill: But the bar only opens at night. I'm sorry.
0x117A3|Manya: I finally understood the truth behind this rumor. Manya: There's no way there are two such princesses in the world.
0x117A4|Manya: The princess in the castle won the martial arts tournament? Manya: If there is such a strong princess, I would definitely like to meet her.
0x117A5|Manya: ``You must be naive to invite this Manya-chan to dance. Manya: If I really danced, men's eyes would be glued to me.''
0x117A6|Manya: “Ah…” Bars are really relaxing.
0x117A7|Wow Wow.
0x117A8|I wonder if there is still a seaside telling place...
0x117A9|Apparently there is a shadow ruler behind King Leo's King Balzac. Rumor has it that it is not human.
0x117AA|Apparently there is a shadow ruler behind King Leo's King Balzac. Rumor has it that it is not human. When I told this to a warrior named Ryan, he left in a panic.
0x117AB|Oh my, are we meeting again? There are a lot of people coming to see the prisoners these days...
0x117AC|Clift: ``What's the tell-all place...? Maybe that's a place you should stop by.
0x117AD|Manya: ``Ah, I was surprised. For a moment, I thought the monster was a torne cat. Manya: ``Because, you know, it looks pretty similar in the stomach area...''
0x117AE|Minea: “Father and Mr. Orin’s Kataki….Now….
0x117AF|Manya: If King Leo, Balzac, and <HERO> are together, I don't feel like losing at all!
0x117B0|Alina: So the king of this country isn't human? Alina: I don't really understand, but it's extremely suspicious that he's not human.
0x117B1|Bligh: I'm a little worried about that warrior named Ryan. Bligh: I hope Ryan doesn't have such erratic ideas...
0x117B2|Manya: Hey Minea. Isn't it kind of creepy here? It's definitely a prison.
0x117B3|It is said that the Emperor of Hell will rise again soon. And so I was able to take a walk at night.
0x117B4|Teka?
0x117B5|It's going to be a breeze. Hiyu and Mudou meet each other and say, ``Oh, you came here again.''
0x117B6|What makes Endo feel nostalgic for that country? It's easy to see from here... ``The king's control has become even stricter since he escaped on a boat.There will be no more ships leaving after Takatatsu.Are you an emperor?You say it's a magic key?
0x117B7|There are things in this world... be
0x117B8|Dana Koru! I don't sell it at my store. From what I've heard, if you're an alchemist
0x117B9|Rode. Looks like I've created a magic key. There must have been an alchemist in the village of Komiz, a little south of Bligh. Ishihata

0x117BB|Tamaya
0x117BC|I'm going to see you there... Me too
0x117BD|Sano Chideumi went and fought at Am.

0x117BF|Nozu
0x117C0|Kodeya
0x117C1|I wonder where it went. It's about time to eat
0x117C2|Even though it's time... cormorant? The ship that left Takatasa safely ended...
0x117C3|Konou Ino. It's a town that I missed. It's the town where Endo Moni's boat departs. However, I missed the last boat.
0x117C4|Manya this. Torneko: ``What is the Emperor of Hell?''
0x117C5|Ha, it seems like this story about how to play is spreading.
0x117C6|Minea: “I... maybe it would be better if I keep a low profile for a while...”
0x117C7|Manya: “Dancer sisters, by any chance, are you referring to me? Manya: “Ahahaha…” No. I’m sad.
0x117C8|He has become a celebrity.
0x117C9|Torneko: ``As expected, I've never handled a magic key.
0x117CA|Minea: “Alchemist... and father.”
0x117CB|Then, did you know anything about the magic key?
0x117CC|Seka.
0x117CD|Alina: ``Yes, yes. Have you heard about Bly's old tales yet?''
0x117CE|Bly: “Me too.
0x117CF|Withdraw money! It has been through many difficult battles...
0x117D0|Bligh
0x117D1|``The king was born in the middle of nowhere, and the ships and the vehicles were all in the same place.'' ``I don't know what happened.''
0x117D2|is the sea
0x117D3|There will be a new town in Bajaero Sominea.
0x117D4|Alina: ``In that case, I'll swim to Endo, and Minea will stand up.''
0x117D5|It's impossible.
0x117D6|Panon: ``I found myself in a hole in Havaria...It's hard to understand! It's a small town...I guess.'' Panon: ``We're all friends in a port town...''
0x117D7|? Is this moving?
0x117D8|Minea: “Me and my sister
0x117D9|I feel sad for this port town.
0x117DA|My sister is out. Nonono
0x117DB|mosquito……. Minea: “No.
0x117DC|in a place
0x117DD|This is not the time to be with my sister.
0x117DE|It was...
0x117DF|Pissarro: ``Is there any purpose in this place?
0x117E0|I don't care about that.
0x117E1|Is it Minato Ikusa Shiitai? picture? Na
0x117E2|Do you mean? It's no big deal.
0x117E3|.
0x117E4|Yotenori
0x117E5|On the other side
0x117E6|There is a town I would like to visit.
0x117E7|is.
0x117E8|Lucia: ``Seaside towns are very crowded.'' Lucia: ``I wanted to see it at least once when I came to land.
0x117E9|is.
0x117EA|Clift: ``It's a port town, and it has a different atmosphere than a normal town, so it's quite nice.
0x117EB|Manya: “I came here too.
0x117EC|Inaroro It's been a while.
0x117ED|There is a book called ``The complete collection of lyrics of the mine man's songs.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. We'll dig ♪ We'll dig as far as we can ♪ Dig, dig, dig, dig through ♪ ...But I couldn't sing it to {7f4b} because I didn't understand the melody.
0x117EE|There is a book called ``A life that lives in this world.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. In this world, not only us humans, but also many other forms of life live together. Although there are some species that cannot understand each other, there are also many species that should be able to get along with each other. If you see a hobbit or an elf somewhere, never bully them.

0x1196E|Jill came to see Onago, who killed Ola's brother. I have to tell you how good you are!
0x1196F|It is decorated with beautifully drawn landscape paintings.
0x11970|There are many nautical charts. It has been used so much that the corners of the book are frayed.
0x11971|Purupurupururu! ! Dear Pizarro! Don't go anywhere now! Let's live here in peace with Rosalie!
0x11972|Jiggling? Is it true that Rosalie helped Pizarro? If it's true, I'd like to meet Pizarro.
0x11973|Purupuru…. I heard it. Mr. Pizarro was alone at Rosalie's grave, saying this. The promise we made to live together will be reborn and fulfilled. Mr. Pizarro, I wonder if he wants to die...
0x11974|Purupuru! Rosalie-chan was captured by a greedy person! Rosalie's ruby ​​tears cannot even be touched by humans...
0x11975|However, as soon as Ruby's tears landed on {7f4c}'s hands, they shattered...
0x11976|Ruby tears fell from Rosalie's eyes... {7f4c} has obtained Ruby Tears!
0x11977|Rosalie: Please! Please defeat Master Pizarro's... No, Despisarro's ambition! Rosalie: I don't want that person to commit any more crimes... Rosalie: Even if it means taking that person's life... Ugh...
0x11978|Rosalie: ``The world...is about to be destroyed by monsters.'' Rosalie: ``The name of the one who suppresses the monsters is Pizarro.'' Rosalie: ``He now calls himself Despisarro, and he is using the secret of evolution to become an even more frightening being.
0x11979|Well! You are humans! ...but it's strange. You have sharp eyes unlike other humans... Let's believe in you. My name is Rosalie. Please listen to me.
0x1197A|Apparently there is a staff of Henge in the royal tomb on the southwestern cape of Endor. If I use that staff, I wonder if I can get into the monsters' castle.
0x1197B|Purupuru! If you bully Rosalie-chan, I won't do anything! picture? Aren't you here to bully me? Then I'll tell you something good.
0x1197C|Ugh... ugh... No one... can pass through here... Argh!
0x1197D|Nunu! You're human! I can't let this pass! He will succeed!
0x1197E|Rosalie: “It has arrived... This feeling of mine...”
0x1197F|Rosalie: Someone, someone... stop Pizarro... Rosalie: If this continues, the world will perish... Rosalie: Please... someone please accept my wish...
0x11980|Rosalie: “…….
0x11981|Rosalie: “Please wait! Mr. Pizarro!
0x11982|Pissarro: Listen, Rosalie. I have decided to destroy all humans. Pissarro: For that purpose, I intend to use the secrets of evolution to become even more gigantic! Pissarro: The world will soon be consumed by the flames of judgment. Pissarro: Until my work is finished, Rosalie, you will hide here...
0x11983|Rosalie: Yeah... Mr. Pizarro.
0x11984|Pizarro: Have you been a good girl, Rosalie?
0x11985|Clift: Mr. Pizarro, you look complicated.
0x11986|Rosalie: I'm sure he'll be overjoyed when he sees Pizarro's face.
0x11987|Rosalie: "No, we really have to hurry...
0x11988|Torneko: ``Being reborn... Ah, I'm really no good anymore.
0x11989|Alina: Of course I love fighting, but... Alina: If there's a way to resolve things other than fighting, then that's fine.
0x1198A|Torneko: ``Being reborn... Ah, I'm really no good anymore.
0x1198B|Clift: ``Let's think about it. If you think about it, I'm sure you'll find another path.
0x1198C|Minea: “Because Rosalie-san is already dead... there's nothing we can do...
0x1198D|Manya: "At this rate, Despisaro must be seriously planning to destroy us humans..." Manya: "Ah! Really, what should we do!? Minea: Do you have any good ideas?
0x1198E|Alina: Of course I love fighting, but... Alina: There's nothing I can do other than fight.
0x1198F|Ryan: If this happens, we'll be lost as to where we should go. Ryan: Is it really justice to defeat Despizarro...?
0x11990|Minea: “I feel sorry for that slime...”
0x11991|Ryan: If possible, I'd like to find the person who captured Rosalie... Ryan: There are so few clues.
0x11992|Manya: ``Perhaps we can't judge whether something is good or bad by race. Manya: There are good monsters and there are bad humans... I'm completely troubled.
0x11993|Torneko: ``That's a sad story~. I started crying. Ugh...''
0x11994|Minea: It's kind of sad... But... Minea: I can't just sit back and watch the world end...
0x11995|Manya: We can't have ruby ​​tears.
0x11996|Ryan: ``Despisaro. Don't forget that name.''
0x11997|Bligh: ``That's a difficult thing. It's only when we love each other that sadness can arise...'' Bligh: ``...Oh, my God.'' I guess that line didn't suit me at all.
0x11998|Clift: ``It's hard to believe that the world will suddenly be destroyed by monsters, but... Clift: I just can't believe that this story is a lie.''
0x11999|Alina: ``Rosalie is such a pitiful person.
0x1199A|Hoffman: ``I believed that slime story.''
0x1199B|Alina: “Slimes are weirdly knowledgeable no matter where they are.
0x1199C|Clift: The cape southwest of Endor... That's where the royal tombs of Santheim are located. Clift: You might think that the story of the slime is worth believing.
0x1199D|Torneko: ``I've also heard about the Henge Wand through rumors on the wind. Torneko: It's said to be a cane that can change its shape into various things. I don't know if it's true or not, though.
0x1199E|Bly: Hmm. It's true that there is treasure in the royal tombs of my Santheim. Bly: But... that slime, I wonder how you knew about it...
0x1199F|Well, Rosalie. He was alive. Since you were kidnapped by humans, all the animals in this village have lost their energy. Everyone was berating themselves for not being able to protect you from humans.
0x119A0|Well, Pizarro is there! I can't believe you're with humans. Is that so? Everyone in the village wanted to meet you. Take your time and sleep.
0x119A1|There are many different types of humans. That's what I thought when I was looking at you. From now on, I think we should stop thinking that because we are humans or because we are demons...
0x119A2|I wonder where the elf will go after being chased by humans. Come to think of it, the guy living in the well in this village was saying something strange.
0x119A3|Meow Meow! I have to thank Mr. Pizarro! The reason we animals can talk like this is all thanks to the secrets of evolution.
0x119A4|Once upon a time, there lived a young demon named Pizarro in this village. Pizarro left the village with an outrageous ambition to rule the world, but he only smiled kindly at Rosalie.
0x119A5|Meow Meow! I have to thank Mr. Pizarro! This is all thanks to the secret of evolution.
0x119A6|Wanwan! I got Pizarro to make me smarter. You can even speak human language!
0x119A7|Heheen! Don't worry, Master Pizarro will take care of it. Heheen!
0x119A8|When the Emperor of Hell returns, will we, hobbits, be destroyed too? I'm worried...
0x119A9|This is the church of hobbits and animals. This is not the place for you humans to come. Go away.
0x119AA|Manya: ``When Sister talked to Pizarro, he fell silent. Manya: I saw that even if he tried to be cool, he couldn't get excited in front of Sister. Hehe.
0x119AB|Minea: The secret of evolution that turned Balzac into a monster was also used like this.
0x119AC|Clift: Let's just follow what Sister says now.
0x119AD|Minea: It's just as Sister said. Minea: This is not a place for us humans.
0x119AE|Torneko: Ambition? I also have an ambition to become the world's biggest merchant... Torneko: It's not like I can't understand Pizarro's feelings at all.
0x119AF|Ryan: Anyone who has ambitions to rule the world has already committed a crime. Ryan: No matter what the situation, you must never hesitate.
0x119B0|Bligh: Ambition sometimes drives people away... It's the same for humans and demons.
0x119B1|Arena: “The more I hear about it, the less I understand who Pizarro is.
0x119B2|Minea: The secret of evolution that turned Balzac into a monster was also used like this.
0x119B3|Manya: If there was a secret method of evolution, animals would be able to talk, too.
0x119B4|Ryan: ``I don't know what kind of person Pizarro is.
0x119B5|Bligh: Pissarro again? I've heard that name a lot.
0x119B6|Alina: I was surprised! I wasn't prepared for horses to talk!
0x119B7|Clift: Let's be honest and follow what Sister says now.
0x119B8|Minea: ``This is not a place for us humans.'' Minea: ``This is not a place for us humans.
0x119B9|Rosalie: Mr. Pizarro...
0x119BA|Ro... Rosalie! Best of all, he was alive! No, please listen to me! I know. That day when humans kidnapped Rosalie... Someone among the demons led the humans to Rosalie-sama's room!
0x119BB|Hey Pizarro, welcome back! No, please listen to me! I know. Talking about humans, talking about stories, talking about that day... Someone among the demons led the humans to Rosalie-sama's room!
0x119BC|This tower was built by Pizarro. Apparently, that person was cautious and had built a hidden room somewhere in the tower in preparation for his departure. And he was hiding his beloved there...
0x119BD|Grrrr...
0x119BE|This tower was built by Pizarro. Apparently, that person was cautious and had built a hidden room somewhere in the tower in preparation for his departure. And there are rumors that something important is hidden there.
0x119BF|Minea: “I wonder what it meant when the monsters kidnapped Rosalie...”
0x119C0|Manya: So, the worst thing about it is that it's a monster after all? Manya: If that's the case, you'll feel a little better.
0x119C1|Clift: Oh my god! Does that mean there's a mastermind who set the humans up! Clift: We must never forget this story.
0x119C2|Bligh: If someone from the demon race... then we'll naturally know where they're going.
0x119C3|Pizarro: ``Hmm. Looks like it's pretty much what I was thinking.'' Pizarro: ``If you listen to what I just said, I'm sure you can imagine where you guys should go.
0x119C4|Clift: ``I had no idea there was a mechanism like this.
0x119C5|Well, Rosalie! I can't believe it. I can't wait to see you again like this... Humans have not given up on us yet.
0x119C6|Elves who were chased from their homes by humans now live close to the World Tree. I don't know why the elves chose that location, but... AaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaA Apparently the elves are now living close to the World Tree.
0x119C7|Elves once lived in the northwest near a village called Imru. However, humans began to live in that area, and the elves were forced to leave their homes. Poor thing....
0x119C8|Rosalie: ``I think it's a wonderful thing to be alive.'' Rosalie: ``I can meet the people I want to meet...how precious is just that...''
0x119C9|Arena: If I go there, I wonder if I'll be able to understand the elves better.
0x119CA|Bligh: ``Perhaps you should keep this story close to your heart.''
0x119CB|Ryan: Speaking of Imru, it's a village near my Butland Castle. Ryan: It's also the first time I've heard that that village had such a past.
0x119CC|Oh, you're Rosalie there, aren't you? Elves and humans are acting together, and times have changed.
0x119CD|Good night....
0x119CE|An elf named Rosalie lived in this village. Elf Rosalie's tears turn into rubies. That's why she was always targeted and bullied by bad people, and she shed ruby ​​tears.
0x119CF|Rosalie: Everyone has a misunderstanding. That humans and elves don't get along. Rosalie: Actually, it doesn't matter whether humans or elves are on good terms or not...
0x119D0|Manya: I'm sure people who bully elves are bullied on a daily basis in human society. Manya: ``...Aaah! It's really getting to the point where humans can't tolerate it anymore!''
0x119D1|Manya: People who bully elves must be bullied on a daily basis in human society. Manya: So, they're accumulating the... things and throwing them at the people. It's pathetic.
0x119D2|Minea: I feel sorry for that elf named Rosalie. Minea: It's sad, but there are bad people among humans. This is the reality.
0x119D3|Ugh... Rosalie has come back to life. I still can't believe it. But it's true. Ugh...
0x119D4|Ugh... I never expected Rosalie to die. I still can't believe it. I feel like I'll come back sometime soon. Ugh...

0x119DF|Bligh: ``It's such a mysterious stone. A sunken stone.

0x119F3|Alina: ``I like caves because you can fight rare monsters.''
0x119F4|Manya: ``I don't like caves because they're damp and humid.If I could, I'd like to wait in the carriage.''
0x119F5|Torneko: “What kind of treasures are hidden there? When you think about it, it becomes fun to go into a cave.
0x119F6|Ryan: ``It looks like many monsters commonly seen in the sea will appear here.''
0x119F7|Panon: I never heard a word about being brought to a cave like this.
0x119F8|Bligh: Wow! That's dangerous. I almost fell over!
0x119F9|Manya: ``If I let my guard down, a monster will suddenly appear out of the water, so it doesn't bother me at all.''
0x119FA|Clift: If only there weren't any monsters, it would be a nice and clean place.
0x119FB|Torneko: ``Wow. Maybe it's because of the high humidity, my clothes are starting to get stiff.

0x11A3E|Manya: ``This is a disgusting place where I've been bullied by fake <HERO>s over and over again. Manya: ``Let's leave now.''
0x11A3F|Manya: ``I've got the jewel, so let's get out of here quickly.'' Manya: ``If I wait, I feel like another fake will appear, so I can't calm down.''
0x11A40|This is the ship's dock. But now, with no ships to build, it's lonely. I guess no one would think to build a new ship if there were so many monsters like this.
0x11A41|I miss the time when I was building a boat for the Torneko family! Since then, no one has dared to build a ship with their own money.
0x11A42|When I grow up, I'm definitely going to become a sailor. So I travel around the world by boat.
0x11A43|I wanted to be a sailor. Lots of toys! just kidding…….
0x11A44|yay! It's a ship! It's a ship! It's my first time on a boat! That's why I'm so happy! Yay Yay!
0x11A45|Oh already! Why are children like that? I can't sit still for a moment.
0x11A46|When will we be able to launch a ship? If things continue like this, all the luggage I packed will get spoiled.
0x11A47|I don't understand what a merchant does! No matter how many ships we build, something is wrong with the lighthouse and we can't take it out!
0x11A48|This is the ship's dock. We are currently building a new ship. The most beautiful ship you've ever seen will be completed soon.
0x11A49|Just a little, just move away! If you stand in a place like that, you'll get in the way of carrying your luggage!
0x11A4A|picture? Who owns the ship? I'm busy right now. Don't ask your parents about that.
0x11A4B|Huh? Are you all the monsters in the lighthouse in place of the Torneko family? But don't overdo it.
0x11A4C|The ship is about to be completed, so what is Torneko's father doing? ? I hope it wasn't eaten by the monster in the lighthouse.
0x11A4D|Whose ship is this? It seems like it costs a lot of money.
0x11A4E|Wow, that's a big ship! When will it be completed?
0x11A4F|Torneko: "I'm big!? Torneko: I don't like it. I'm just a timid person. Well, I have a big stomach, though.
0x11A50|Torneko: ``When I was a child, I also dreamed of being a sailor. Torneko: Well, actually, that's how I became an arms dealer, but it seems like it was my calling.
0x11A51|Alina: ``You're a bit of an unusual kid, aren't you? You're a boy who admires being a sailor.'' Alina: ``If you're a boy, you'd probably aspire to be a martial artist who fights coolly with your bare hands, right?'' Alina: ``At least that's what happened to me.''
0x11A52|Ryan: ``It's not bad to be a sailor, but I would recommend becoming a warrior.'' Ryan: ``I think every man would aspire to be a warrior, especially one who serves the royal palace.''
0x11A53|Hoffman: ``It's said that the ships built at Conan Berry are the best in the world.'' Hoffman: ``When you look at this dock, it makes sense.
0x11A54|Minea: ``It's a big place, but it's kind of messy. I don't feel at ease here.'' Minea: ``I like small, neat and tidy places.
0x11A55|Manya: ``That's right. Last time I came here, there were a lot of boats lined up and a lot of people...'' Manya: ``It's kind of lonely now. I wonder if they don't build ships anymore?''
0x11A56|Torneko: "When I was building my ship, this place was always lively, but..." Torneko: "Now there's no trace of the bustle it once had. It's sad.
0x11A57|Bligh: ``It seems that Torneko's ship was built at this dock. Bligh: Hmm. The craftsmen in this town are quite skilled.
0x11A58|Clift: I've been here before, but Conanberry is truly a port town.
0x11A59|Arena: If Santheim had a large space like this, we could use it as a martial arts practice area. Arena: But for me, fighting monsters outside is the best way to practice.
0x11A5A|Ryan: ``If there's no ship at the dock, it's a very desolate and unsettling place.
0x11A5B|Hoffman: Torneko, the rumored great merchant! Oh my god. I thought I'd finally meet you!
0x11A5C|Manya: If Torneko were really dead, what would we do with this ship? Manya: If you don't have any use for it, why don't you give it to us?
0x11A5D|Minea: Mr. HERO. I feel a special connection to the person named Torneko. Minea: Why don't we go to the lighthouse in the east and help?
0x11A5E|Hoffman: ``It's said that the ships built at Conan Berry are the best in the world.'' Hoffman: ``When you look at this dock, it makes sense.
0x11A5F|Minea: ``It's a big place, but it's kind of messy. I don't feel at ease here.'' Minea: ``I like small, neat and tidy places.
0x11A60|Manya: ``How spacious is it! It's amazing that two large ships can fit inside!
0x11A61|It is said that a long time ago, in the far northeast sea, a ship loaded with stolen goods was attacked by monsters and sank. It is said that there was a mysterious shiny armor inside. That armor is now at the bottom of the sea... maybe it was stolen by a monster.
0x11A62|Hoffman: Northeast of this continent, it's quite an undeveloped area. It's a dangerous area with strong monsters.
0x11A63|Minea: “For a monster to take away an armor, that armor must have been very important to the monster.
0x11A64|Manya: ``It's such a waste. I'm sure all of that stuff is rusty by now.''
0x11A65|The ship heading south to Mintos was said to be the most sacred ship, and the princess of Santheim was on board. She must be a beautiful princess. I too wanted to take a look.
0x11A66|I'm the captain of this ship. sled
0x11A67|Young. Mudamu: ``As soon as the ship and the ship left the port, the lighthouse was dark.
0x11A68|The sea gets really rough. Just recently.
0x11A69|Noto. There's no way to go out!
0x11A6A|Minea: The princess of Santheim has a young priest and an old wizard.
0x11A6B|It seems that there is already. Minea: “Both of the princesses, King Dewatsusatsu, are reliable people.
0x11A6C|Manya: If she was the princess of Santheim, I also heard the rumors in Endor. Manya: She said she won a martial arts tournament, so she must be a very tough princess.

0x11AE7|I headed to the stand. But it seems like it wasn't possible after all, so I'm back in town now. Huh? So I was worried about you?

0x11AE9|I headed to the stand.
0x11AEA|A map of the surrounding area of ​​Conan Berry is attached to the wall.
0x11AEB|There is a new logbook that has not been used yet.

0x11AED|Are you really worried about...?
0x11AEE|Hoffman: I'm really worried. I thought I'd be able to meet the rumored great merchant Torneko...
0x11AEF|Minea: ``You really are a reckless person. Do you get bolder when you think there are no people around?'' Minea: ``But I have to say that going alone was a thoughtless move.

0x11DEF|It is said that in Mintos, in the south across the sea, there is an old man who is like the god of business. Since he's the god of business, he must be good at making money. I want to play with you.
0x11DF0|From now on, I must be careful not to let the lighthouse's sacred flame die out again.
0x11DF1|Hey, thanks to you guys, I can get a job carrying luggage again. Thank you!
0x11DF2|It seems that the monster nesting in the lighthouse has finally been defeated. But my ship remains sunk. Hohoho....
0x11DF3|Don't do that! My eyes aren't holes. Nerds are the kind of people who end up doing terrible things.
0x11DF4|As expected. I knew it right away!
0x11DF5|They say people don't depend on appearances, but you guys aren't just people, are you?
0x11DF6|picture? Did you defeat the monster in the lighthouse? thank you! With this, this port town will be revived.
0x11DF7|The Great Lighthouse in the East is back to normal! It looks like the ship has set sail, and it's all thanks to you guys!
0x11DF8|Torneko: ``Well, everyone, let's set off for the unseen land!
0x11DF9|Torneko: "Oh, thank you! Well, let's go. Torneko: Eh? A horse-drawn carriage? Of course, a horse-drawn carriage can also board the ship. Torneko: "Well, let's go!
0x11DFA|Torneko: Don't say that, do something about it! Please!
0x11DFB|Torneko: "You did a great job! The evil flames have disappeared, and now the sea is so calm. Torneko: And to my delight, my ship has been completed! Torneko: I have a favor to ask of you. In fact, I seem to be envied by the monsters. Torneko: But I'm sure it will be very reassuring to be with strong people like you. Torneko: Please join me too. Together. Let's travel around the world!
0x11DFC|It is said that if you collect small medals, you can exchange them for valuable treasures later.
0x11DFD|Ah, thank you! Let me tell you something good in return. It is said that if you collect small medals, you can exchange them for valuable treasures later.
0x11DFE|Please don't say that. Don't miss it!
0x11DFF|Sorry! I just happened to be able to do it... But I just tried to steal it, but I haven't stolen it yet. Please don't miss it....
0x11E00|! !
0x11E01|Ah, my ship... Grrrr...
0x11E02|This dock is closed at night. If you want to see inside, come back tomorrow!
0x11E03|What? What about you? I was just preaching God's teachings to her.
0x11E04|As long as there is love, there is no difference in age... Does God really say such things?
0x11E05|Torneko: "Hello, is that you? I was looking at the sea right now. Torneko: "Yes. The ship should be completed soon. I believe in you and will be waiting for you!
0x11E06|It is said that in Mintos, in the south across the sea, there is an old man who is like the god of business. Since he's the god of business, he must be good at making money. I want to play with you.
0x11E07|It is said that until recently, the great lighthouse in the east was burning a sacred flame. But now that lighthouse is lighting an evil fire that can sink ships.
0x11E08|My job was to carry cargo for ships. But since there were no ships to leave port, I was completely bored out of my time.
0x11E09|My ship sank shortly after leaving the port. All of this happened because of the monster that lived in the eastern lighthouse. When the ship leaves the port, an evil light is emitted from the lighthouse and sinks the ship!
0x11E0A|Did you come to see the ship? If it's a ship, it's built at the dock. It's a big building at the port.
0x11E0B|Well, that's bad luck. There were boats out there until a while ago... A strange monster had taken up residence in the eastern lighthouse, making it impossible to sail.
0x11E0C|Welcome! I'd like to say that, but I don't really feel like doing business. After all, we can't sail. This is a shame for a port town!
0x11E0D|Hello traveler. This is the port town of Conanberry.
0x11E0E|Panon: ``Collect little medals!...Oh? How are you doing now? Huh? Is it no good? That's tough.
0x11E0F|Minea: Is a small medal really that expensive to exchange for a precious treasure? Minea: I don't think it has that much value...
0x11E10|Manya: “What? Is that all you’re going to tell me as a thank you?”
0x11E11|Toruneko: ``There is a race of people in this world called collectors.'' Toruneko: ``Even boring things that are nothing to ordinary people seem to be treasures to them.''
0x11E12|Ryan: Is it okay if I let that person pass? Ryan: Well, I won't do anything stupid again. You're a cheapskate, looking at people who are guilty or injured. It's good that you let them through!
0x11E13|Alina: ``When you're told not to go in, you want to go in.'' Alina: ``Why don't you just blow up the wall? Huh? No? It's boring.
0x11E14|Minea: ``Father, you're stupid...''
0x11E15|Manya: Well, I agree that age differences don't matter as long as there is love, but... Manya: But those lame, repetitive complaints won't fix anything.
0x11E16|Clift: "As long as there is love, age differences and even social status don't matter!" Clift: "I wish I could say that with confidence, but right now, it's just...fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu.
0x11E17|Ryan: “As long as there is love, age difference doesn’t matter… That’s great. That’s a line I’d like to say as well.”
0x11E18|Hoffman: I've also heard for some time that there is an old man in Mintos who is called the God of Business. Hoffman: I'd really like to learn about his teachings as a merchant.
0x11E19|Minea: Well, it's not because if she had money, she would spend it as much as she had! Minea: Exactly! I can't believe how much trouble she put me through because of that...
0x11E1A|Manya: ``Ah~. There are so many rich people in this world, so why am I poor? Manya: God is not fair!
0x11E1B|Torneko: ``The path of business is different from just making money. Torneko: It's troubling that so many people misunderstand this.
0x11E1C|Alina: ``Oh, you're talking about that old man named Hirutan.'' Alina: ``He's the god of business.'' He said some difficult things, but I couldn't understand why.
0x11E1D|Minea: ``If you defeat a monster, the sunken ship will rise to the surface...It's not that common in this world.
0x11E1E|Manya: "Hmm. You're a truly miserable person. Manya: "But, well, you're alive, so I'm sure good things will happen in the future!
0x11E1F|Torneko: "Now that I think about it, if my ship had been completed a little earlier, it might have been sunk..." Torneko: "When you think about that, it's hard to believe that that person's misfortune was someone else's problem.
0x11E20|Manya: “Wait, Minea! What does that mean?”
0x11E21|Minea: ``You're not just an ordinary person, are you?'' It's true that your sister is not an ordinary person. Minea: ``Whether or not you mean it in a good way...
0x11E22|Manya: "It's not what I look like? Manya: If you look at this nice buddy, you'll know at a glance that I'm not just an ordinary person!
0x11E23|Bligh: Of course, we're not just people. We're the Princess of Santheim and her followers.
0x11E24|Ryan: Hehehe. After all, we can't hide the fact that we're not just people.
0x11E25|Lucia: Wow, it's a port town! There are a lot of ships in a port town, right? Lucia: Where are they? I'd like to see a lot of ships.
0x11E26|Panon: ``It's very difficult to do a gag in Conan Berry.
0x11E27|Hoffman: Conanberry is the largest port town in this area.
0x11E28|Minea: When I come to a port town, I remember Habaria. Minea: The town where I ran away from King Leo Castle and set sail in despair...
0x11E29|Manya: ``Huh? It's a pretty big town. There's a bar, right?...I wonder if there's a casino?
0x11E2A|Bligh: ``I hear Tornekodon's boat was built in this town.Bligh: Hmm.The craftsmen in this town are quite skilled.
0x11E2B|Clift: We once boarded a ship from here bound for Mintos. Clift: And right after that, I fell ill. No, I'm embarrassed to even remember it.
0x11E2C|Alina: Right after we set sail from this town, a monster took up residence in the eastern lighthouse, right? Alina: If I had been here then, I would have defeated the monster right away. What a shame.
0x11E2D|Torneko: Now that I think about it, I was able to join the <HERO> group in this town. Torneko: I'm lucky to have a reliable travel companion.
0x11E2E|Ryan: ``The port town of Conanberry, huh? I feel kind of liberated when I'm here.'' Ryan: ``But what about <HERO>? Don't let it get too loose.
0x11E2F|Minea: Who in the world would trade a small medal for a treasure? Minea: There are some strange people in this world.
0x11E30|Manya: “What? Is that all you’re going to tell me as a thank you?”
0x11E31|Manya: “You’re so stingy. It’s great that you let me through!”
0x11E32|Minea: ``Father, it's a piece of shit...''
0x11E33|Manya: Well, I agree that age differences don't matter as long as there is love, but... Manya: But those lame, repetitive complaints won't fix anything.
0x11E34|Hoffman: ``Is it part of a merchant's talent to make other people do well? Okay, I'll make a note of it.
0x11E35|Minea: "Does that mean that letting you on the ship is in exchange for exterminating the monsters in the lighthouse? Minea: As expected of a merchant. You seem like a good person, but you're also shrewd.
0x11E36|Manya: ``It's so nice of you to force people to exterminate monsters and just stare at the ocean.''
0x11E37|Hoffman: ``I've also heard for some time that there is an old man in Mintos who is called the God of Business.'' Hoffman: ``Well, I'd really like to teach you about being a merchant.
0x11E38|Minea: Well, it's not because if she had money, she would spend it as much as she had! Minea: Exactly! I can't believe how much trouble she put me through because of that...
0x11E39|Manya: ``Ah~. There are so many rich people in this world, so why am I poor? Manya: God is not fair!
0x11E3A|Minea: What kind of scene would it be if an evil light sinks a ship? Minea: I feel like I'd like to see it just a little bit.
0x11E3B|Manya: ``Ah...'' What can I say? It's so tragic that I don't have any words to say.
0x11E3C|Minea: ``Trials are inevitable for a brave man.You have to sell yourself to get on the ship.''
0x11E3D|Manya: Maybe I'm unlucky after all? Manya: I ended up losing 1,000 coins on a slot machine. Manya: Oh! Of course, that was before I met <HERO>!
0x11E3E|Hoffman: Conanberry is the largest port town in this area.
0x11E3F|Minea: When I come to a port town, I remember Habaria. Minea: The town where I ran away from King Leo Castle and set sail in despair...
0x11E40|Manya: ``Huh? It's a pretty big town. There's a bar, right?...I wonder if there's a casino?
0x11E41|If it were me, I'd just be thinking about it... That's why I'm bald. Please tell me to go to bed early too.
0x11E42|It seems that a village that was destroyed by monsters was recently discovered deep in the mountains far north of Blanca. It is said that the Sun across the sea, evil, evil, evil, evil, and evil, disappeared without even the slightest hint of evil... Maybe this has something to do with the rumor that the Emperor of Hell will rise again...
0x11E43|Minea: The village that was destroyed is <HERO>'s village, right? Minea: I have one more reason to hate monsters.
0x11E44|Manya: What's wrong <HERO>? You look pale.
0x11E45|Hoffman: That's a terrifying story. Will such a monster really come back to life? Hoffman: Oh, it's the end of the world!
0x11E46|Bligh: Who... and why did the people of Santheim disappear? Bligh: Even with all of Bligh's wisdom, this is a completely incomprehensible incident.
0x11E47|Clift: ``I can't believe that even your father, the king, and the people of Santheim have all disappeared...'' Clift: ``When I think about the princess's suicide, Clift's heart tightens.
0x11E48|Alina: If the reason your fathers disappeared is because of that Emperor, then I won't forgive you! Alina: I don't know if it's the Emperor of Hell or something, but I'll definitely punch you!
0x11E49|Hoffman: That's a terrifying story. Will such a monster really come back to life? Hoffman: Oh, it's the end of the world!
0x11E4A|Minea: “Emperor of Hell...” I wonder if he has something to do with Balzac and the others?
0x11E4B|Manya: What's wrong <HERO>? You look pale.

0x11E64|Rama also decided to go. I have suffered a lot until now. This time it's really magical...I just need to find it.

0x11E66|….
0x11E67|You guys are amazing! You defeated the monster in the lighthouse, right? I knew right away because the sea was calm.
0x11E68|No way. What are you answering seriously? It's got to be a joke, right? Hehe.
0x11E69|Is this your first time at this store? Hey, I'll give you plenty of service, so why don't you hang out with me until morning?
0x11E6A|Are you on a trip looking for someone? Come to think of it, a strange trio came to visit me a while ago. The princess and her companion said they were looking for a man named Despisaro.
0x11E6B|Hiccup! ...Ugh. I went to buy a map, but it was out of stock... According to the map shop there, they get their maps from Mintos... I'll be coming in next time.
0x11E6C|Yo! Listen! That's right
0x11E6D|. Save up your money and someday own your own boat... But hey...when I have money, I end up drinking! That's sad. Ugh...
0x11E6E|Mr. Torneko is definitely Kagami of the weapon shop! He plans to buy a ship and travel around the world looking for legendary weapons. Wow, that's a big deal.
0x11E6F|That's bad. The bar opens at night. Please come again at night.
0x11E70|That's a shame. Please come again.
0x11E71|Oh no! I thought there was still a lot, but now it's gone. That's strange...
0x11E72|welcome! How about a world map to accompany your cruise? I'm sure it will be helpful.
0x11E73|Minea: “<HERO>-san, you’re an asshole.
0x11E74|Manya: Are you that disappointed after <HERO>? Manya: Why don't I stay with you until morning? Manya: Ahahaha... I think you're making a big hole for me. Of course I'm just joking.
0x11E75|Bligh: ``Thank you, I need some stimulation for the elderly.''
0x11E76|Aitsu Hoffmann said, ``At the same time, I died without any age at all.''
0x11E77|Clift: ``What did I expect...?'' Clift: ``Oh God. Please punish this sinful me.''
0x11E78|Alina: Does service mean that you'll pay for food and drinks? Alina: But it's bad for your health to stay up and eat and drink until the morning.
0x11E79|Ryan: ``Nuhhh! It's not like you're joking! I was seriously worried...''
0x11E7A|Hoffman: "Are you a princess? That's great. I'd like to travel with a princess, too." Hoffman: "Oh, no. I'm not saying I don't like traveling with you all.
0x11E7B|Minea: ``Despisaro...'' I've heard that name several times, but it somehow feels ominous to me. Minea: ``Who on earth are you?
0x11E7C|Manya: "Are we looking for someone? Manya: Oh, yeah. We were looking for someone to be our traveling companion.
0x11E7D|Hoffman: It's said that the maps made by Mintos are the most accurate in the world. Hoffman: It's said that everyone who travels by sea loves Mintos maps.
0x11E7E|Minea: When you realize that you can't buy something, you become desperate for it. Minea: The more out of reach you become, the more attractive it becomes.
0x11E7F|Why does it happen?
0x11E80|Manya: If you want it that much, you should just go to Mintos yourself. What an astounding man.
0x11E81|Minea: “A weak-willed person... That’s no good.
0x11E82|Manya: ``I understand how that person feels.'' Manya: ``When I have money, I end up drinking alcohol and spending it on casinos. Manya: ``But that's a human way of life, isn't it? What's with that sigh!?
0x11E83|Torneko: Fortunately, I'm not a drinker, so I had my own boat.
0x11E84|Ryan: ``You're such a sloppy guy. I've always said that even if you drink, you shouldn't be drunk.''
0x11E85|Toruneko: ``If someone told me to my face that I'm Kagami from a weapon shop, I'd get scared.'' Toruneko: ``But the truth is, I'm not the kind of person who deserves praise.'' Toruneko: ``For the sake of my dreams, I'm not the kind of person who deserves to be praised.''
0x11E86|Wait a minute, Minea... It's not a good idea at all.
0x11E87|Hoffman: ``If you don't notice when something is out of stock, you've failed as a businessman.''
0x11E88|Manya: “What?! Let me make you look forward to it, but it’s not like you don’t have something, right?
0x11E89|Toruneko: ``It's a shame that it's sold out.'' Toruneko: ``Well, if we really need something, it'll naturally come to us sooner or later.'' Toruneko: ``That's the bond between people and things.
0x11E8A|Clift: There's something strange about a map disappearing before you know it. Clift: A thief? But what would he do if he stole a map?
0x11E8B|Minea: “<HERO>-san, you’re an asshole.
0x11E8C|Manya: Are you that disappointed after <HERO>? Manya: Why don't I stay with you until morning? Manya: Ahahaha... I think you're making a big hole for me. Of course I'm just joking.

0x11E99|Torneko: ``Hmm... Nene... Poporo... Dad... he's munching.

0x11E9D|船を 魔物たちに沈められ 自殺した人も いたとか。 Poor thing....
0x11E9E|The locked room there is an open room. It is said that the person who stayed in that room was turned into skeletons the next day. Oh so scary...!
0x11E9F|Minea: Are you a monster's minion or something? Minea: But there's nothing to worry about.My fortune-telling says the cruise will be safe.
0x11EA0|Manya: What are you doing now? You said something sinister... Manya: That kind of nonsense won't get through to us!
0x11EA1|Torneko: "Does this mean that my ship is going to sink? Torneko: "Oh my god!...But, as long as you're here, we'll be fine, right? Torneko: After all, we're a group of legendary heroes.
0x11EA2|Alina: ``That's a crappy guy! I should have hit him once before he disappeared.''
0x11EA3|Ryan: What a challenge! But you monsters, don't think it'll go your way!
0x11EA4|Minea: “Poor... I pray for the soul of the deceased.
0x11EA5|Manya: It's ridiculous to commit suicide just because you've lost a ship! Manya: How many times have I almost despaired... Manya: My father was killed, I failed to kill Kataki, I lost money at the casino... Manya: Even so, I'm still living strong today!
0x11EA6|Torneko: ``Losing a ship and then committing suicide is a difficult story to deal with.'' Torneko: ``As the owner of the same ship, I sympathize with that person.
0x11EA7|Clift: To commit suicide is to go against God's teachings. Clift: Even if you lose everything, as long as you're still alive, you can start over as much as you want...
0x11EA8|Hoffman: Wow. How scary! Hoffman: Mr. HERO.
0x11EA9|stone.
0x11EAA|Minea: I can definitely feel an unusual presence coming from that room. Minea: It doesn't seem like what that person said was a total lie.
0x11EAB|Manya: “What? I won’t be scared by such a made-up story!
0x11EAC|Alina: ``Will there be a monster in this room? If I can hit someone, I'll blow them away.''
0x11EAD|Ryan: ``Well, the Red Room is interesting. Ryan: ``If I could, I'd like to stay there and find out the truth.''

0x11EB5|I haven't seen the man named Hoffman who was in this town until the other day.
0x11EB6|I hope the fathers come home early today.
0x11EB7|Padekia root can cure any disease, but it's extremely bitter and bad! That's why I'm careful not to get sick!
0x11EB8|Come to think of it, a little
0x11EB9|Wow
0x11EBA|
0x11EBB|らまん。 Town of Clift Nin
0x11EBC|Hey. It looked like he had come from far away.
0x11EBD|My hometown is a village with a small castle on the far edge of this continent. I haven't been back to the village for a while, but I wonder if they're still cultivating padekia...
0x11EBE|Grrrr...
0x11EBF|Good night....
0x11EC0|Aren't we great? I'm taking care of your house.
0x11EC1|When I was younger, I had a terrible illness. But an old man from Soletta village brought me padekia roots and cured me.
0x11EC2|Minea: Mr. Hoffman... I hope you're doing well.
0x11EC3|Clift: ``Does it taste like padekia? Yes, if I had to compare it to a cake made by a princess...'' Clift: ``No, no, I don't mean to say it tastes bad or bitter!''
0x11EC4|Bligh: I went to Soretta and finally got Padekia. Now, hurry to the inn, Clift!
0x11EC5|Torneko: Don't you sometimes miss your hometown?
0x11EC6|Bligh: ``Children have strong resilience. No matter how much Padekia is considered a panacea, I wonder if it will work for Clift as well... Bligh: No, I have no choice but to believe. Now, hurry up and return to the inn, and give Padekia to Clift!
0x11EC7|Bligh: If the princess hears about it, she'll probably say she'd like to try it again.
0x11EC8|Minea: “Ryan…. I’m curious about that name for some reason. I wonder why.
0x11EC9|Manya: ``I don't mind being tough. It just depends on my face.''
0x11ECA|Bligh: I wonder how far Princess Alina has gone these days... Hmm. I hope she's okay.
0x11ECB|Minea: Padekia is the name of a medicinal herb that is effective against all kinds of illnesses. I've heard of it before.
0x11ECC|Bligh: The princess must have headed to Soletta in search of Padekia. Let's hurry too!
0x11ECD|Minea: Padekia can be grown in the country of Soretta. Well, I didn't know that.
0x11ECE|Grrrr...
0x11ECF|I also took Old Man Hirtan's test... ah! I still don't know the answer! I wanted a treasure map!
0x11ED0|Hiltan: ``Hoffmann would have left this town. Hiltan: He's learned a lot. He has nothing to teach me anymore. Hiltan: By now he's probably somewhere out there trying to build a new town like me.
0x11ED1|You can't. I am a servant of God. ...Pop.
0x11ED2|If you like this flower, please accept it! That's how I feel!
0x11ED3|There are many people who want to start their lives all over again in a new place. If you introduce them to the perfect place, they will surely appreciate it.
0x11ED4|Mintos started from Old Man Hiltan's inn... There was also a disciple of old Hiltan called Hoffmann.
0x11ED5|He set out on a journey to build a new town. I hope that Mr. Hoffman's town will prosper like Mintos.
0x11ED6|It seems that a merchant who used to live in this town set out to build a new town. I believe...his name was Hoffman.
0x11ED7|Hiltan: ``That man named Hoffmann. Apparently he's an acquaintance of yours. He's a very hard worker. Hiltan: ``I'm going to train him hard and make him a fine merchant like me!''
0x11ED8|You can't. I am a servant of God. ...Pop.
0x11ED9|If you'd like... why don't you go see the sea on your next day off? ?
0x11EDA|King Leo of the west is said to be a terrifying person, and Soletta of the east is unimpressive. Hmm, where should I go next to do business?
0x11EDB|If you take a boat from here and go straight west, you'll arrive at King Leo's castle.
0x11EDC|Hoffman: It seems that Old Man Hirtan's success was because he started an inn here.Hoffman: Hmm, that's instructive!
0x11EDD|Hiltan: ``I started an inn to get information from travelers in order to solve the secret of the treasure map, but...'' Hiltan: ``I'm already rich enough. I don't need treasure anymore.''
0x11EDE|I can't. I am a servant of God. ...Pop.
0x11EDF|In fact, from the moment I laid eyes on you...poof.
0x11EE0|Is it? It looks like you fell asleep. I can't help but feel sleepy listening to that old man's story. I have no choice but to go back to sleep! Good night!
0x11EE1|Hahahahaha... Hakushon!
0x11EE2|It's getting cold. This is the town of Mintos.
0x11EE3|Hirtan: ``I got that treasure map when I was young, but I was never able to uncover its secret...'' Hirtan: ``Well, I'm sure you can do it! {7f33}, do your best!
0x11EE4|Hirutan: ``Maybe you can uncover the secret of that map...'' Hirutan: ``I thought so, but your belongings are full! Come on out!''
0x11EE5|Hiltan: ``Alright, I'll send you this treasure map.'' Hiltan: ``I got it when I was young, but I finally got it.''! What are you talking about? I'm not here...'' Hiltan: ``Take it!
0x11EE6|{7f4c} “???
0x11EE7|Hiltan: ``Hmm! Come on! I won't say anything... In other words! Silence is golden! Miana Hiltan: ``Now then, the question is! What is the most important thing in business?
0x11EE8|Hiltan: “I see.
0x11EE9|Good luck... go.
0x11EEA|Hiltan: ``Oh, you understand. I know a lot about the world, not just the sea.'' Hiltan: ``Looks like you have some nerve. Hiltan: How about you? Would you like to take my test?''
0x11EEB|Hiltan: ``You idiot! I know a lot about the world, not just the sea.'' Hiltan: ``When you ask someone, you do your research properly. Come back!
0x11EEC|Hiltan: "What? The old man who knows a lot about the sea is me?
0x11EED|Hoffman: Well then. Hmm, business isn't about money, it's about making customers smile...
0x11EEE|Hoffman: Oh, Mr. {7f4c}! Hoffman: I'm just asking Old Man Hirtan to teach me the secrets of business.
0x11EEF|Indeed, the story of Old Man Hirtan is instructive. Sell ​​your heart, not your things! I have come to this...
0x11EF0|I am also a merchant's daughter. I have to study business. But I wonder what the person next door is up to!
0x11EF1|Gugo Gugo.
0x11EF2|Old man Hirtan was said to have been an adventurer when he was young. It is said that he obtained various treasures and used them to run a successful business.
0x11EF3|Nago.
0x11EF4|Ba ba ba ba!
0x11EF5|Since he is said to be the god of business, I wondered what kind of a fine person he was, but he turned out to be just an old man. picture? Old man Hirtan is giving a lecture on that hill.
0x11EF6|Although Mintos is now a large town, it was once a small village. After the owner of the inn, Old Man Hirtan, built a fine inn here, travelers gradually began to gather here...The small village eventually became a large town. It's all thanks to old man Hiltan.
0x11EF7|Myau Myau.
0x11EF8|It seems that a traveling priest staying at the inn has fallen seriously ill. If only I had the legendary medicinal herb Padekia, I'm sure it would be cured...
0x11EF9|We have a good room available today!
0x11EFA|welcome! Please stay here for the night!
0x11EFB|This is the town of Mintos. It is a town where there is an old man, Hiltan, who is a favorite of those who do business. Many people come to this town to listen to Old Man Hirtan's stories.
0x11EFC|Hoffman: Thank you! Hoffman: I'll never forget you all. The importance of having faith... Hoffman: Stay well, Patricia. Goodbye, everyone! I wish you all the best!
0x11EFD|Hoffman: Don't say that! Please!
0x11EFE|Hoffman: By the way, everyone! Hoffman: Thank you very much for traveling with me all these years. Hoffman: Mr. {7f4c}. My dream was to someday follow in my father's footsteps and become a great innkeeper. Hoffman: In Mintos, there is an old man called Hirtan, who is called the god of business by the merchants. Hoffmann: I am working under old Hirtan. I want to continue my training.Hoffman: I fully understand that this is a selfish request. Please, Mr. {7f4c}.Hoffman: Please let me bid farewell to you all. Please!
0x11EFF|Hoffman: “…….
0x11F00|Hoffman: That's right! Hoffman: It's the town of Mintos! It's Mintos from old Hiltan, who is known as the god of business!
0x11F01|Hoffman: “What about this place?
0x11F02|A big torch is burning.
0x11F03|The World's Best Merchant Hiltan's Inn
0x11F04|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x11F05|Ryan: ``I can't believe he's going to a new place and trying to build a town all by himself. He seems like quite a man.
0x11F06|Alina: Hey, Hoffman was your friend for a while, right? Let's help him build the town!
0x11F07|Torneko: "Ah, I'm so jealous. Someday, I want to become a merchant who can build a town like Mr. Hoffman!
0x11F08|Manya: In other words, Hoffman is the creator of a new town... Tsk. He let something delicious escape!
0x11F09|Bligh: ``Hmm. You're so young. Hohohoho.
0x11F0A|Alina: ``Isn't that person shaking so much that he hasn't noticed that all of the flower petals are falling off?
0x11F0B|Manya: “Oh my god, are you doing this? It’s so frustrating! There’s no such thing as this!!
0x11F0C|Ryan: ``Endor Mintos I used to travel around the world looking for heroes. Ryan: ``But I never imagined that I would have surpassed them before I knew it.''
0x11F0D|Bligh: Is that okay? Before anything else, you have to be healthy! Take care of your body on a daily basis.

0x11F0F|Alina: ``When Clift collapsed, he looked extremely blue and suddenly started shaking! Alina: ``I beat him every time he said he was okay, and hurriedly carried him back to the inn.''
0x11F10|Torneko: ``Well, I'm tired today! Let's just relax at the inn!''
0x11F11|Minea: ``This is the town where I said farewell to Mr. Hoffman and met Ms. Alina...'' Minea: ``I have a lot of memories in Mintos.
0x11F12|Manya: “…
0x11F13|When it comes to that. Call me. Alcohol! The liveliness of the bar! Manya: “What? Mintos doesn’t have a bar, right? Ah, I want to drink!
0x11F14|Panon: ``It seems interesting to pursue new laughter in a new land.
0x11F15|Ryan: ``I've never wanted to start my life over again. I live every day with no regrets.''
0x11F16|Minea: ``I want to start my life over again in a new land...that's right, in a place where my sister isn't here.'' Minea: ``Oh, it's just a job. Yes, it's just a job. It's really a job.''
0x11F17|Torneko: ``Maybe I should train in this town after all...''
0x11F18|Manya: ``Tch, you're done! Don't say anything! I didn't spit on Hoffman! Manya: ``Ah, I'm an idiot! Buying Aota...

0x11F1C|Minea: “I feel nostalgic about the days when I was traveling with Mr. Hoffman...
0x11F1D|Manya: “Hoffmann’s guy isn’t in this town anymore. I wonder if he’s doing well?”
0x11F1E|Panon: ``If you come to Mintos, be sure to meet Old Man Hirtan and see what Mintos is!'' Panon: ``Wahaha! Even though I'm in pain, Hara hurts!''
0x11F1F|Ryan: ``Endor Mintos I used to travel around the world looking for heroes. Ryan: ``But I never imagined that I would have surpassed them before I knew it.''
0x11F20|Bligh: Is that okay? Before anything else, you have to be healthy! Take care of your body on a daily basis.
0x11F21|Clift: ``Thank you for all your help at Mintos... Ha... I miss you so much.
0x11F22|Alina: ``When Clift collapsed, he looked extremely blue and suddenly started shaking! Alina: ``I beat him every time he said he was okay, and hurriedly carried him back to the inn.''
0x11F23|Torneko: ``Someday, I would like to become a merchant on a par with Old Man Hirtan.
0x11F24|Minea: ``This is the town where I said farewell to Mr. Hoffman and met Ms. Alina...'' Minea: ``I have a lot of memories in Mintos.
0x11F25|Manya: The bed in the Mintos inn is my favorite so far.
0x11F26|Torneko: ``I'd like to discuss this with you, but there's no way I'm going to become an apprentice to Old Man Hirtan...'' Torneko: ``No, I was just trying to say it. There's nothing like that right now!
0x11F27|Minea: I'm sure Mr. Hoffman will become a better merchant than Old Man Hirtan.
0x11F28|Clift: ``A heart that sways among the faithful... It's painful.''
0x11F29|Alina: ``You can't see the ocean by yourself. What are you talking about?
0x11F2A|Manya: “Whoa, whoa! I told you so. Good luck!!
0x11F2B|Bligh: ``I hope you don't get influenced by the princess, are you being rude?'' Bligh: ``Hmm, I'm worried.'' She grumbles.

0x11F2F|Even the monsters are fine! It's so much fun.
0x11F30|Torneko: For some reason, both Manya-san and Minea-san have become completely silent. Torneko: Did something unpleasant happen at King Leo?
0x11F31|Minea: "We are no longer alone as sisters. This time, we won't give up at all..." Minea: "No, nothing. It's nothing. Nothing...
0x11F32|Manya: "I can't believe I'm hearing King Leo's name again in a place like this. I guess this is also fate. Manya: Whatever. Let's go. To King Leo. Maybe he's there too!
0x11F33|Bligh: There's always a reason for a king to receive bad rumors. Bligh: King Leo can hardly be called a great monarch.
0x11F34|Manya: King Leo... He... I'm sure Balzac is too. I'm sure he's over there.
0x11F35|Alina: ``Next time I'm on a ship, I'll definitely climb to the top of the mast! Alina: ``Hehe, I'm looking forward to it!''
0x11F36|Torneko: ``It's okay. If it's my ship, I'll take Ryan for a year or two.

0x11F40|Torneko: ``Maybe if we took a handful of soil from here and buried it in our garden, our store would be great.''
0x11F41|Minea: That princess. I wonder if she's still in Padekia's cave...?
0x11F42|Manya: ``Hey! I've been caught! I can't move anymore!'' Manya: ``Let's take a rest at the inn. I won't let you say no.

0x11F47|Minea: That princess. I wonder if she's still in Padekia's cave...?
0x11F48|Manya: The city air is really nice! The liveliness! It's so refreshing! Manya: I'm a festival lover at heart. It makes me come alive again.
0x11F49|Toruneko: ``If you have that kind of enthusiasm, you'll win.'' I think so.

0x11F4F|Minea: “Are you sure that sisters and fortune tellers are seen as stubborn women?
0x11F50|Bly: Hohohoho. This old man was like that when he was young.
0x11F51|I used to woo a woman.
0x11F52|Manya: “You’re so annoying! At times like that, you have to hold me by your shoulders!”
0x11F53|Alina: Does it feel good to sleep outside? I'd like to try it sometime.
0x11F54|Minea: A carefree person...
0x11F55|Panon: "Hmm. That man can do it...! That way of removing it, that way of breathing. I can't keep it up.

0x11F58|If you walk around wandering around, you'll become a delinquent!

0x11F5A|Torneko: ``Maybe if we took a handful of soil from here and buried it in our garden, our store would be great.''
0x11F5B|Minea: It was no coincidence that we came to this town. Yes, we were guided... Minea: I feel it.
0x11F5C|Nosa! Let's stay and follow our hearts. Destiny awaits.
0x11F5D|Minea: “In an inn that big, the rooms and beds must be comfortable.
0x11F5E|Manya: ``When Hoffman was here, he helped me carry all my heavy luggage.'' Manya: ``Ah, I'm tired. Hey, hey, let's get some rest now.''
0x11F5F|Manya: “Despite it being a big town,

0x11F64|Bligh: If that old man were to let loose, it would be like twisting a baby's hand if he caught Bligh's hand.Bligh:...But that's too easy.Let's just stay here.
0x11F65|Clift: I don't understand how rich people would randomly give something to a traveler even though it seems important.
0x11F66|Torneko: ``It's a treasure map! It gives me chills. I wonder what's hidden there.''
0x11F67|Manya: “Yay! It’s a treasure map! Treasure, treasure! Let’s go find it right away!

0x11F6C|Torneko: ``I have to listen to this story again! Because you're curious!''
0x11F6D|Minea: Are Old Man Hiltan's dentures so loose? Sometimes they look like they're going to fly over here... Minea: Huh? That's off topic! Shimo, I'm sorry, I wasn't listening because I was too worried about the dentures.
0x11F6E|Manya: ``I don't like the way you talk to me. But the person I'm talking to is a rich person, after all.'' Manya: ``Let's try to get him to find out what he's hiding!''
0x11F6F|Bligh: ``Wow. Is that the man who was traveling with you all the other day? He's the kind of man who can't be poisoned or medicated.
0x11F70|Torneko: ``Hmm, you took the class so enthusiastically. Mr. Hoffmann: You're doing your best.
0x11F71|Manya: ``Hey, wait! Did you see that?! That Hoffmann face! It's annoying!'' Manya: ``What do you mean, you look happier than when you were traveling with this Manya-sama? Absolutely!

0x11F74|Torneko: I wonder if my Popolo will follow me too.
0x11F75|Manya: Could it be that this woman is targeting Old Man Hirtan too!? Even though she has a plain face, I can't admire her.
0x11F76|Bligh: Alina-sama used to fall asleep in front of her tutor. Hmm. How nostalgic.
0x11F77|Minea: “Uh, noisy snoring….And it makes me sweat. That person is at home.

0x11F7C|Manya: “All kinds of treasures are jewelry, money, money, money, money…!?
0x11F7D|Bligh: I don't know if he's a god of business, but he's just an old man. I don't think he can compete with my grace.
0x11F7E|Manya: ``It doesn't matter if your face is wrinkled, sluggish, or bald, it's okay!'' Manya: ``Come on! Hurry up and let's go see that Hiltan old man!''
0x11F7F|Torneko: ``Someday, I want to become a great merchant who can even start a town.'' Torneko: ``I'm jealous of Mr. Hoffman, who became my apprentice.
0x11F80|Manya: So the whole town belongs to old Hiltan! Wow! How much is it going to cost? Manya: If you pay back my debt, you'll get some easy change. Gulp. That might be good...
0x11F81|Bligh: Looking for Padekia... At most, I'm going to take up a lot of trouble with my servant. Hmm.
0x11F82|Bligh: He was supposed to protect the princess, but instead he made her look for medicine, which is totally inappropriate! Bligh: You idiot, Clift. You need to cure her illness quickly and give her a tough lecture!
0x11F83|Torneko: Padekia Padekia, what have you heard?
0x11F84|Minea: I once saw the legendary medicinal herb Padekia in my father's magic book. Minea: It's said to be able to instantly cure any serious illness. However, it's hard to get hold of.
0x11F85|Torneko: Old man Hirtan is famous among his fellow merchants. After all, he is the god of business!
0x11F86|Manya: ``I wonder how much money he's saved up? That old man named Hirtan.'' Manya: ``I'm curious...''
0x11F87|Bligh: ``I'm so excited to be traveling with a young girl at my age. Ho-ho-ho. Bligh: Hmm? I wonder if Princess Alina is different? Hmm, in that case, there are a lot of things...
0x11F88|Bligh: It's said that Clift's stupid illness can't be cured without medicine from some other country. Bligh: Come on! Let's hurry and chase after the princess!
0x11F89|Torneko: ``I wish I could have talked to Mr. Hoffman about a few more things.''
0x11F8A|Torneko: Hoho. This is the town of the famous Old Man Hirtan! Oh, I'm so happy.
0x11F8B|Minea: It was no coincidence that we came to this town. Yes, we were guided... Minea: I feel it.
0x11F8C|Nosa! Let's stay and follow our hearts. Destiny awaits.
0x11F8D|Manya: ``When Hoffman was here, he helped me carry all my heavy luggage.'' Manya: ``Ah, I'm tired. Hey, hey, let's get some rest now.''
0x11F8E|Manya: "Old man Hiltan, I'm sure he's still single, right? Manya: Yeah! That's cool! Hehehe. What are you talking about? They say men aren't about their faces.
0x11F8F|Minea: Mr. Hoffman's dream. I hope it comes true. Hey <HERO>!
0x11F90|Hmm, I guess I should try becoming an apprentice to Old Man Hirtan after all.
0x11F91|Don't you know Hoffman, who worked at this inn before? Oh, he would have come out. Now that I've finished my training here, I'm going to build a new town like Old Man Hirtan. destination? here we go. I don't know that much.
0x11F92|We have to try harder not to lose to Hoffman!
0x11F93|I wonder where Hoffman is and what he's doing these days. I'm talking about that nice guy. I'm sure he's doing well, but I'm worried.
0x11F94|Hoffman, who was at this inn before? Oh, he would have left. There's nothing left to teach you, so go your own way, Old Hirtan told me.
0x11F95|If you work hard, something good will happen to you someday. That young man named Hoffman. I'm sure it will be successful.
0x11F96|I also came all the way to become Old Man Hirtan's apprentice, but... The training seems to be tough, so I guess I should go back to my hometown.
0x11F97|I've been forced to clean the floors for five years now. That Hoffman has only been an apprentice for a short time, but he's already in charge of the store. I was able to make a difference...
0x11F98|Hoffman, my new apprentice, is a really nice guy. Even when you meet someone for the first time, you completely believe in them. Your honest nature is your strength!
0x11F99|Ah, I'm tired. Huh? Is the new Hoffman guy still working? That's great.
0x11F9A|That new guy, Hoffman, is doing quite well. I've been cleaning floors for five years now, but he's already in charge of the store. Hohoho….
0x11F9B|Hoffman: ``I've been allowed to take care of the store. Okay, I'll do my best!'' Hoffman: ``Everyone, please be careful and continue your journey!''
0x11F9C|I also came all the way to become Old Man Hirtan's apprentice, but... Hmm, it seems like merchant training is tough. What should I do?
0x11F9D|Hikuhikuhiku! Oops, I was smiling all the time, so my face fell. The basis of customer business is a bright smile! ...However, it's tough.
0x11F9E|My new apprentice, Hoffman, is working really hard. Even after work, he seems to be listening to Old Man Hiltan talk about various things.
0x11F9F|Ah, I'm tired. I can finally take a breather. Training to become a merchant isn't easy either.
0x11FA0|On the eastern edge of this continent, there is a small country called Soletta. When I told the princess who was at the inn about this, she panicked and ran out.
0x11FA1|Ah, I'm tired. Old man Hiltan is really rough with people. I guess I made a mistake in becoming his apprentice after all...
0x11FA2|Bligh: ``Those who try hard will always be defeated. Remember that.''
0x11FA3|Alina: "Isn't it a little exciting to be in a new town? That's great. It looks like it's going to be fun.
0x11FA4|Torneko: ``Mr. Hoffman's town. I'm sure it's going to be great.'' That's how I feel.
0x11FA5|Manya: ``Because my first impression was that he was the worst! He was sullen and quiet. Manya: ``You've turned into a monster, Hoffman...'' Ah, you failed! You should have spit on him.
0x11FA6|Torneko: ``I see Mr. Hoffman was popular with his friends at the inn. He must have been a nice person.''
0x11FA7|Torneko: ``I remember. When I became independent from my master, he said something similar to me.''
0x11FA8|Manya: ``Hoffmann is annoying too. You just left without leaving us a message?''
0x11FA9|Alina: ``That guy Hoffman is a hard worker, so he must be physically strong.'' Alina: ``What? You want to travel together? That's great. If we had met around that time, we could have had a side-by-side comparison!''
0x11FAA|Manya: I want to show you the twisted Hoffmann when we first met!
0x11FAB|Minea: Mr. Hoffman, you're working really hard. I'm glad.
0x11FAC|Alina: “Hey, who is that? Does everyone know each other?”
0x11FAD|Torneko: ``Looks like Mr. Hoffman's training is going well. Wow, that makes me smile.''
0x11FAE|Manya: ``Oh, hey, just now! It was Hoffman, right? Wow, that's a mistake.''
0x11FAF|Bligh: What's the man at the inn saying? Come on! Hurry up to the second floor and give Padekia to Clift!
0x11FB0|Manya: I want to show you the twisted Hoffmann when we first met!
0x11FB1|Bligh: What's the man at the inn saying? Come on! Hurry up to the second floor and give Padekia to Clift!
0x11FB2|Minea: Mr. Hoffman, you're working really hard. I'm glad.
0x11FB3|Bligh: What's the man at the inn saying? Come on! Hurry up to the second floor and give Padekia to Clift!
0x11FB4|Torneko: ``Hoffman, I want to know and understand. Oh my, it makes me smile.''
0x11FB5|Manya: ``Oh, hey, just now! It was Hoffman, right? Wow, that's a mistake.''
0x11FB6|Bligh: ``I don't even want to see that man's smile, even if I get paid for it!'' Oh, it's creepy. He grumbles.
0x11FB7|Torneko: ``My boss is someone who doesn't like to laugh. Torneko: That's why I was always in charge of the shop. Look at that bright smile!
0x11FB8|Manya: ``Dancing girls are also basically smiling. In my case, when I dance, I have fun and my face naturally smiles.
0x11FB9|Minea: “Hehe. I feel happy when Mr. Hoffman is praised.
0x11FBA|Manya: ``Hmm...I don't think any of the men will get fired up.'' I guess he's the owner of the shop after all.
0x11FBB|Bligh: "Did the princess head to Soletta? I hope nothing happens on the way. Hmm..." She grumbled.
0x11FBC|Manya: If I were a princess, I'd rent out this whole inn and have lots of nice men... Manya: I'd put money in the bathtub and swim in it. Hehehe. I want to try it, even if it's only once.

0x1213D|I can't believe he was a brave man! A warrior named Ryan, who had previously stayed at this inn, was searching for a hero. If I remember right, Ryan said he was going to King Leo, a country far to the west...
0x1213E|Arena: I heard from Bly that <HERO> is also looking for Despisaro!?
0x1213F|Clift: Me too
0x12140|Use the handshake to print it out.
0x12141|Alina: ``I'd like to meet those people! Could you bring me there?''

0x12143|Bri: ``...That's about it, Princess.Actually...
0x12144|Arena: Hurry up! Give that Padekia to Clift!
0x12145|Alina: Oh, Bray! You've come back to Buji! Alina: What!? You got the Padekia root!? Alina: You didn't have it when you went, so you came back saying you couldn't do it anymore, but when you Bullai, you're going to do it! Alina: Hurry up! Give that Padekia to Clift!
0x12146|Alina: “Oh, Bligh! You’ve come back to Buji! Alina:”
0x12147|Easy? ? I couldn't find the roots. Ah, what should I do...?
0x12148|Alina and the others went outside and got into the carriage!
0x12149|Alina and the others have joined the group!
0x1214A|Alina: ``Well! That's right! Well then, let's search together. The more you travel, the more fun it is.
0x1214B|Clift: It seems that the village where the hero lived was once destroyed by Despisarro. What if <HERO> is...?

0x12156|The princess just came back, but she didn't seem to be feeling well. Isn't it strange that your companion is sick? I'm worried....
0x12157|Grrrr...
0x12158|Bly: ``Then I'll go first! I have to ask the people at the inn about this Clift. Bly: ``After that, I'll be waiting outside! See you later!''
0x12159|Bligh: Oh, thank you! Well then, I'll accompany you with this blithe as well!
0x1215A|Clift: “Hmm, hmm….
0x1215B|Bly: "I guess it's no good...
0x1215C|Bligh: As you can see, my traveling companions have become seriously ill. Bligh: Our master, Princess Alina, went to get medicine by herself, but I'm so worried... Bligh: It's unreasonable to ask strangers, but I see you're a kind-hearted person! Bligh: Please, find Princess Alina and help her. Can't you get it?

I have just come to the rumored town in search of a magic wand. I immediately tried to listen, but it seems that this time my troubles will be borne out. looking for
0x1215F|Although the magic wand was not found in this town, it seems to be in a cave near the town. Why do people in this world keep their precious treasures in caves? . . . . . . . . . .

0x12160|Clift: ``I don't have to worry about my body anymore. Let's go to King Leo in the west!''
0x12161|Alina: ``I feel like I've heard of Ryan somewhere...Hmm, maybe it's just my imagination?''
0x12162|Minea: The name Ryan... and the land of King Leo. Minea: Is this also the guidance of fate? Or...?
0x12163|Manya: ``I can't sit still when I hear about King Leo. Let's go to our hometown.
0x12164|Bligh: ``I've been helped by everyone with whom I have no connections. I must repay the favor. Bligh: Come on! I'll follow Bligh wherever you go!

0x1216B|Bligh: Oh my god... Clift, you idiot. I was wondering what was going to happen. Bligh: I didn't expect you all to be traveling in pursuit of the same enemy. Bligh: No, no, I'm happy. I look forward to your continued support!
0x1216C|Minea: As expected, those people were also guided by... Minea: In any case, I've gained three reliable friends at once. Especially that princess! Ufufu.

0x12171|Manya: Princess, it seems like you don't remember us. Manya: We just briefly passed each other in the cave, so don't worry.

0x12176|Manya: Princess, it seems like you don't remember us. Manya: We just briefly passed each other in the cave, so don't worry.

0x122FA|A warrior named Ryan, who had previously stayed at this inn, was searching for a hero. If I remember right, Ryan said he was going to King Leo, a country far to the west...
0x122FB|Please wait! Even though I knew it was bad, I overheard it. <HERO> is the hero who will save the world! A warrior named Ryan, who had previously stayed at this inn, was searching for a hero. If I remember right, Ryan said he was going to King Leo, a country far to the west...
0x122FC|Arena: I heard from Bly that <HERO> is also looking for Despisaro!?
0x122FD|Clift: I would love to meet you too.
0x122FE|Alina: ``I'd like to meet those people! Could you bring me there?''
0x122FF|Alina: “Huh!? What?! Besides us, there are other people looking for Despisaro!?
0x12300|Bri: ``...That's about it, Princess.Actually...
0x12301|Arena: Hurry up! Give that Padekia to Clift!
0x12302|Alina: Oh, Bray! You've come back to Buji! Alina: What!? You got the Padekia root!? Alina: You didn't have it when you went, so you came back saying you couldn't do it anymore, but when you Bullai, you're going to do it! Alina: Hurry up! Give that Padekia to Clift!
0x12303|Alina: Oh, Bry! You've come back to the bush! Alina: In the end, we couldn't find any padekia roots. Ah, what should we do...?
0x12304|Alina and the others went outside and got into the carriage!
0x12305|Alina and the others have joined the group!
0x12306|Alina: ``Well! That's right! Well then, let's search together. The more you travel, the more fun it is.
0x12307|Clift: It seems that the village where the hero lived was once destroyed by Despisarro. What if <HERO> is...?
0x12308|Alina: What's wrong? Alina: Huh? <HERO> also uses Despisaro!?
0x12309|{7f4b} “…………!
0x1230A|Alina: ``It's okay, Clift. Let's continue our journey to find Despisarro!''
0x1230B|Clift: "I'm embarrassed...I'm the one who should protect the princess, but I'm complaining like this.
0x1230C|Alina: “Good! You noticed, Clift!
0x1230D|Clift: Hmm... Ha! Princess!
0x1230E|Lucia ground up {7f17} and gave it to Clift to drink! Soon, Clift's complexion improved and he recovered!
0x1230F|Bly: I'll never forget this favor!
0x12310|Arena: “Many... many...?? to Clift!
0x12311|Alina: Well! You guys are the roots of Padekia? Alina: I didn't go there, so I'm really happy that you came back even though I couldn't do it anymore! Alina: Hurry up! Give that Padekia to Clift!
0x12312|The princess just came back, but she didn't seem to be feeling well. Isn't it strange that your companion is sick? I'm worried....
0x12313|Grrrr...
0x12314|Bly: ``Then I'll go first! I have to ask the people at the inn about this Clift. Bly: ``After that, I'll be waiting outside! See you later!''
0x12315|Bligh: Oh, thank you! Well then, I'll accompany you with this blithe as well!
0x12316|Clift: “Hmm, hmm….
0x12317|Bly: "I guess it's no good...
0x12318|Bligh: As you can see, my traveling companions have become seriously ill. Bligh: Our master, Princess Alina, went to get medicine by herself, but I'm so worried... Bligh: It's unreasonable to ask strangers, but I see you're a kind-hearted person! Bligh: Please, find Princess Alina and help her. Can't you get it?
0x12319|Clift: “Hmm, hmm….
0x1231A|There is an old book written ``In Search of the Magic Wand, Chapter 3''. I picked up {7f4b} and read it. I am the wizard Madrue. I have just come to the rumored town in search of a magic wand. I immediately tried to listen, but it seems that this time my troubles will be borne out. The magic wand they are looking for is not found in this town, but it seems to be in a cave near the town. Why do people in this world keep their precious treasures in caves? Thanks to this, people like me have to suffer a lot. I hate caves!
0x1231B|Bligh: ``I've been helped by everyone with whom I have no connections. I must repay the favor. Bligh: Come on! I'll follow Bligh wherever you go!
0x1231C|Clift: ``I don't have to worry about my body anymore. Let's go to King Leo in the west!''
0x1231D|Alina: ``I feel like I've heard of Ryan somewhere...Hmm, maybe it's just my imagination?''
0x1231E|Minea: The name Ryan... and the land of King Leo. Minea: Is this also the guidance of fate? Or...?
0x1231F|Manya: ``I can't sit still when I hear about King Leo. Let's go to our hometown.
0x12320|Bligh: ``I've been helped by everyone with whom I have no connections. I must repay the favor. Bligh: Come on! I'll follow Bligh wherever you go!

0x12325|Manya: ``I can't sit still when I hear about King Leo. Let's go to our hometown.
0x12326|Torneko: "Traveling is a cruel world! Isn't that great? Torneko: "The more people you have, the more fun the journey is. Hey, <HERO>-san!
0x12327|Bligh: Oh my god... Clift, you idiot. I was wondering what was going to happen. Bligh: I didn't expect you all to be traveling in pursuit of the same enemy. Bligh: No, no, I'm happy. I look forward to your continued support!
0x12328|Minea: As expected, those people were also guided by the light... Minea: In any case, we now have three reliable friends at once. Especially that princess! Hehehe.
0x12329|Torneko: "Traveling is a cruel world! Isn't that great? Torneko: "The more people you have, the more fun the journey is. Hey, <HERO>-san!

0x1232B|Minea: As expected, those people were also guided by the light... Minea: In any case, we now have three reliable friends at once. Especially that princess! Hehehe.
0x1232C|Minea: ``For now, let's help the sick person first, and then we can talk slowly!''
0x1232D|Manya: Princess, it seems like you don't remember us. Manya: We just briefly passed each other in the cave, so don't worry.
0x1232E|Bligh: Hurry up! Give that padekia root to Clift, who's sleeping in his bed!
0x1232F|Bligh: Hurry up! Give that padekia root to Clift, who's sleeping in his bed!
0x12330|Torneko: Wow, that man looks like he's in a lot of pain! He's not going to die, right?
0x12331|Minea: ``For now, let's help the sick person first, and then we can talk slowly!''
0x12332|Manya: Princess, it seems like you don't remember us. Manya: We just briefly passed each other in the cave, so don't worry.
0x12333|Bligh: ``I hope the princess returns safely! Come on, hurry up and send Padekia to Clift!''
0x12334|Manya: ``Princess, we don't even have a carriage, but we've already arrived at Mintos!? As expected, young girls are different...''
0x12335|Bligh: That's completely useless! That Clift has always been physically weak. Bligh: In the end, he's causing trouble not only to the princess, but also to the travelers. You idiot! He grumbles.
0x12336|Torneko: ``That's right. It's like when my Poporo got measles.''
0x12337|If you go all the way south from here, you'll reach Soletta Castle.
0x12338|Torneko: "If you buy Soretta's famous Padekia, you might be able to make a profit..." Torneko: "Ah, no, no. Of course, that's only after this trip is over! What? Totototo?
0x12339|I'll give you food.
0x1233A|Lucia Red and sweet fruit. Panon: Yeah? Are you talking about apples? Panon: That's it!...That's painful.
0x1233B|Lucia: “I’m glad we got to see so much of the lower world! Where should we go next?”
0x1233C|Hoffman: ``It would be more convenient if there was an inn here as well. Father, I hope you're doing well.
0x1233D|Bligh: ``Still, the door of travel is such a strange thing. The ride is the worst, though.
0x1233E|Arena: ``It's small and the ceiling is low, so I can't move my body as hard as I can!
0x1233F|Torneko: ``A relay point between towns. Hmm, it's a nice property... I think we should set up our second store here.''
0x12340|Manya: “What? Here. Let’s go quickly.
0x12341|Minea: “A quiet place... It calms my mind.
0x12342|Lucia: I believed you would say that! Thank you, {7f4c}. Lucia: You should be able to get to the castle in the sky from the Tower to the Sky. Lucia: And they say you have to obtain all the weapons and armor in the sky to enter the Tower to the Sky. Lucia: Well, let's go!
0x12343|Lucia: “That’s terrible! Mr. {7f4c}, please.
0x12344|Lucia: Could you please take me to the castle in the sky?
0x12345|Lucia: That's truly the Sword of the Sky! Thank you, {7f4c}. Lucia: Now I can go back to my castle in the sky. Lucia: But my wings are broken, so I can't fly.
0x12346|Lucia has joined the team!
0x12347|Lucia: Well! You're taking me there! Lucia: In order to enter the tower to the sky, you must obtain all the weapons and armor of the sky. Lucia: I understand. The Sword of the Sky is somewhere in this tree... It seems to be sleeping nearby. Lucia: Well, let's go.
0x12348|Lucia: Well! You're taking me with you! Lucia: But it seems like you all have a lot of friends right now. Lucia: I'll wait here until you can take me with you.
0x12349|Lucia: I'm sure you think there's no point in going to the castle in the sky.
0x1234A|Please, please help me. I'm Lucia, and I'm a tornado who's descending from the sky to pick up the leaves of the world tree. Lucia: "I was attacked by monsters and my wings were broken. Lucia: Could you please take me back to the castle in the sky?
0x1234B|I don't like it, but please help me!
0x1234C|Ah... please. Someone help me!
0x1234D|But {7f17} couldn't escape!
0x1234E|I found {7f17}!
0x1234F|Pizarro: ``...Hmm. You must be a condescending person to go all the way to a place like this.'' Pizarro: ``Well, that's fine. I'll at least thank you for helping Rosalie.''
0x12350|Rosalie: You gave me the flower of the World Tree to help me... Thank you.
0x12351|Rosalie: “For some reason, I feel relieved when I’m near the World Tree. It’s like returning to my hometown.
0x12352|Ryan: ``When I look at the Etrian Odyssey, I feel stupid for worrying about small things.
0x12353|Bligh: What exactly is the source of the World Tree's power? Hmm. It's an eternal mystery.
0x12354|Clift: ``......'' Clift: ``Oh, I miss the ground.
0x12355|Arena: "It's about time for the enemies around here to be too weak to fight against. Let's go somewhere else!
0x12356|Torneko: "Aaah. I'm hungry. Even the leaves look delicious. I'm already hungry.
0x12357|Minea: “The World Tree is truly a mysterious tree. Looking at it like this makes me feel at peace.
0x12358|Manya: “Hmm, that’s too bad! If you climb up and down too much, your legs will get thick!
0x12359|Ryan: “The flower of the World Tree was just as I expected!
0x1235A|Bligh: ``I sense an extraordinary divine power from this flower.Bligh: However, whether or not you can make good use of that power depends on how you use it.Hum.
0x1235B|Clift: ``I'm glad you got the flower of the World Tree. Let's get off the ground quickly.''
0x1235C|Alina: ``It was quite small for a World Tree flower. It was a little disappointing.'' Alina: ``But it was pretty pretty. Oh my god!
0x1235D|Torneko: "Wow, it's beautiful! I don't do gardening, but it's still beautiful!! Torneko: It's beautiful and smells great. What's more, it has a miraculous power! This is something amazing!!
0x1235E|Minea: The flower of the World Tree says: Use my power for the good of the world...
0x1235F|Manya: ``Amazing! Wow! I've never seen such beautiful flowers before!'' Manya: ``Just looking at them makes me feel happy. They're really beautiful, aren't they?''
0x12360|Ryan: ``The World Tree is also stingy. Wouldn't it be better if the tree were filled with flowers?
0x12361|Bligh: The flower of the World Tree is a precious thing. If you get it, think carefully about how to use it!
0x12362|Clift: ……. Clift: ……. Ah… the ground is so far away… I miss the ground… so much.
0x12363|Alina: ``Now that we've come this far, it's no good unless we see the World Tree's flower.''
0x12364|Torneko: "Grumbling..." How much would it cost to sell it to a king who loves rare things... Torneko: "No, no, I'm kidding! Of course you should use it to help people!!
0x12365|Minea: “What if you could use the flower of the World Tree for someone else?…That’s a difficult question.
0x12366|Manya: It really smells great! Even Endor perfumes don't do this. Manya: With this, I'm sure the flowers will be really beautiful too. Let's go see them soon!
0x12367|Lucia: Only those who have equipped themselves with all the weapons and armor of the sky can climb the tower of the sky. Lucia: Please, climb the tower of the sky and take me to the castle in the sky!
0x12368|Ryan: ``Castle in the Sky'' is a story that's hard to believe, but... Hmm, I guess I have no choice but to believe it.
0x12369|Bly: Before we go to the castle in the sky, we need to remind the princess about etiquette once again! Bly: After all, we're going there as representatives of the humans on earth. We can't let that happen.
0x1236A|Clift: Climbing the tower in the sky... to the even higher castle in the sky... Wow!! Clift: God! Why, why are you going through this kind of trial!? It's so interesting...
0x1236B|Alina: ``Since it's a castle, there must be a king and a princess. I hope it's someone you get along with.''
0x1236C|Torneko: “Are they selling sky crackers and steamed buns at the castle in the sky?
0x1236D|Minea: I'm sure all the knowledge of this world is collected in the castle in the sky. Minea: If my father were alive, I'm sure he would have been jealous...
0x1236E|Manya: "A castle in the sky this time? Hey! We could have gone anywhere, in the sky or underground!" Manya: "Maybe we should do a special dance in front of the people in the sky.
0x1236F|Lucia: ``I come to the World Tree to play sometimes, but haha... Failure, failure! Lucia: But it was nice to meet you all! Thank you!
0x12370|Bligh: ``Wow. It's quite a view. The house looks small, like a pea!
0x12371|Clift: ``…………. Clift: …………. Clift: ``I don't like it anymore.
0x12372|Alina: If I jump as hard as I can from the top of this tree, will I be able to reach the castle in the sky?
0x12373|Torneko: "A sword in the sky? That's what triggered this trip! It's so nostalgic.
0x12374|Minea: “The power that resides in the World Tree is gentle and warm. Yes, it is a very gentle power…
0x12375|Manya: Hey, isn't the sun shining closer than usual? I'm worried about sunburn.
0x12376|Lucia: Thank you! The Sword of the Sky is somewhere in this tree. Please look for the Sword of the Sky.
0x12377|Ryan: "If you're with us, there's no need to fear monsters. Lucia will feel safe, too.
0x12378|Bligh: As if it had been waiting for us to come, a man from the sky descended... Bligh: Is this also some sort of guidance, Minea? Hmm. I grumbled.
0x12379|Clift: You're seriously injured. Poor thing... But... Clift: What's more, there's a castle in the sky in a tower in the sky. Ah, what am I supposed to do? Castles in the sky are full of flowers. Wasn't it just a fairy tale that there were castles in the sky? Alina: But no matter how you look at it, what's on Lucia's back is wings.

0x1237A|Torneko: ``I've been looking for a sword in the sky, too.'' Torneko: ``But I never knew that weapons and armor in the sky had such a role.
0x1237B|Minea: ``...I thought a spirit that couldn't float was asking for help. I'm disappointed. Haa.''
0x1237C|Manya: ``Hey, Skyman, huh? She's not a very cute girl. She still has a long way to go in terms of sex appeal, though.''
0x1237D|Ryan: As a warrior, when a voice calls for help, I must respond! Ryan: We must hurry and find the owner of that voice!
0x1237E|Bligh: ``You're not thinking of abandoning me, are you? Come on, let's come and help!
0x1237F|Clift: ``Anything is fine, let's get down to the ground as soon as possible.''

0x12381|Torneko: For now, let's go closer to the voice!
0x12382|Minea: The voice of the spirit has become stronger! Ah, what are you looking for? Flowers? Or water? Minea: Or... because I'm lonely, you want me to die with you!? Ah, what should I do!
0x12383|Manya: “Hey, what’s going on? A girl is asking for help, but she doesn’t know anything about it!?”
0x12384|Ryan: As a warrior, when a voice calls for help, I must respond! Ryan: We must hurry and find the owner of that voice!
0x12385|Bly: "Hmm!? I heard a young girl's voice! Where is she? Where is she!?
0x12386|Clift: ``......'' Clift: ``I wish I could help you...'' It's so expensive...
0x12387|Alina: ``Someone is asking for help!...Hehehehehe.'' Alina: ``I'm on fire! Come on, I'll help you! You won't complain, right?
0x12388|Torneko: "Yes!? Didn't someone hear a girl's voice just now?
0x12389|Minea: ``...That weak, depressed, exhausted voice right now!'' Minea: ``I'm sure it's the voice of the spirit of an unremovable woman who is possessed by this tree! I can understand it!''
0x1238A|Manya: “Did you hear that!? That voice just now!! Someone is asking for help! We have to help!

0x1239F|Ryan: ``It's such a big tree. I'm sure you'll be able to get a lot of firewood out of it.'' Ryan: ``No, I'm not planning on cutting it down at all... I just thought of it.''
0x123A0|Bligh: The World Tree is the only tree that grows on this earth. It doesn't exist anywhere else. Bligh: So how did the World Tree come into this world? No one has ever known about it.
0x123A1|Clift: ……. Clift: ……. Ah… the ground is so far away… I miss the ground… so much.
0x123A2|Alina: Have you ever tried bungee jumping? I'd like to try it once. Alina: I think the top of the World Tree would be the perfect place. I'm sure it would be fun!

0x124B6|The flowers of the World Tree are so beautiful! But flowers only bloom once every thousand years.

0x124C0|Oh, it's rare for humans to come to this village. This is an elf village.
0x124C1|Rosalie: ``We live in the forest, and we die in the forest. For us elves, trees are like parents.'' Rosalie: ``And I don't think this world tree can do anything, or even a demon.
0x124C2|Torneko: ``There's nowhere to throw away the leaves, flowers, and drops! That's great, Sekaiju!'' Torneko: ``I love great value products like this.
0x124C3|Minea: ``When I'm nearby, I can hear the World Tree's heart. What a kind heart. Minea: I'm sure it's because of the World Tree that all the people living in this village have such gentle faces.

0x124C8|Pissarro: ``To think that Rosalie would be saved by the World Tree, which I once considered burning.'' Pissarro: ``That's completely ironic.
0x124C9|Rosalie: A once-in-a-millennium miracle for someone like me... Thank you.
0x124CA|Bligh: Even the elves... Hmm. I guess that's what you mean. I'm afraid of God's guidance.
0x124CB|Clift: I believe that God's miracles should be given to everyone. Clift: May this world tree heal everyone.
0x124CC|Minea: Are the elves protecting the World Tree? Are they being protected? Minea: Either way, they all seem to be living happily together.
0x124CD|Rosalie: We elves can talk to animals and monsters. Rosalie: It seems like the animals in this village learned human language from the elves.
0x124CE|Bligh: ``Hmm, that's dangerous! I almost put my tail on it!''
0x124CF|Alina: ``If you think about it, it's an interesting fox to be able to talk to humans.'' Alina: ``If it's this one, it would be fun to have it as a pet.
0x124D0|Manya: “He must have been surprised when I showed him this is the flower of the World Tree!”
0x124D1|Pizarro: ``I didn't help Rosalie because I'm an elf.'' Pizarro: ``Hmm. It's nothing. It's just a soliloquy.
0x124D2|Rosalie: Well, there are elves like me in this village! I'm kind of happy.
0x124D3|Ryan: ``Hmm, the air is nice. Being in this village makes my body feel better.
0x124D4|Bligh: As the years pass, it becomes reliable and even blooms at times... Bligh: This world tree. It seems to me that it looks more and more like this old man!
0x124D5|Clift: It would be best to keep this World Tree a secret between us. Clift: We don't know what will happen if someone filled with greed finds out about this tree.
0x124D6|Arena: “Seeing rare things and fighting rare monsters! This is the fun of traveling.
0x124D7|Torneko: ``Someday, this village will also have mine.''
0x124D8|support
0x124D9|I want to release it! Yeah. I'll do my best!
0x124DA|Minea: The beauty of the World Tree's flowers. I think that alone is worthy of the name miraculous.
0x124DB|Manya: "Hey, me and the flower of the World Tree. Which one is prettier? Manya: "What?! Of course it's me. I know, I know!
0x124DC|Bligh: Magic and the church can only help those of us who are guided and helpers. But if it's the flower of the World Tree. Bligh: You have to think about it carefully. It's a once-in-a-millennium miracle. It's not given to rare people.
0x124DD|Minea: "With the power of the World Tree's flower, lives that could not be saved may be revived..." Minea: "If we can obtain the flower, then yes. For whom should we use the power of the flower?
0x124DE|Ryan: ``Since we're here, it might be a good idea to take a look at the flowers of the World Tree.
0x124DF|Alina: ``Do you want to see flowers? That's fine. I'll go out with you. Let's climb the World Tree.'' Alina: ``I'm fine with anything, anywhere, as long as I can fight as many monsters as I can!
0x124E0|Manya: “If it’s something that happens once every thousand years, we should just have a festival. Come on!
0x124E1|Bligh: A miraculous power beyond human wisdom... hmm. That's interesting.
0x124E2|Torneko: ``Even if you ignore miracles, I'd like to see the flowers of the World Tree at least once.'' Torneko: ``These are the flowers of the tallest tree in the world. I'm sure they're the most beautiful in the world!
0x124E3|Minea: What if we're on top of the World Tree... Yes, I'm sure of it! Let's hurry up and climb the tree!
0x124E4|Clift: Come to think of it, it seems like it smells faintly like flowers. ...But are you going to climb?
0x124E5|Alina: "Smell...? I don't really get it, but I'll go anyway.
0x124E6|Manya: ``Oh, it's true. It smells so good! Hey, let's climb a tree!''
0x124E7|Ryan: "These are the words of these incomprehensible people in an incomprehensible world. How much can we trust them..." Ryan: "But it's no good. For now, let's go to the World Tree.
0x124E8|Bly: "Huh? It seems like the sacred power residing in the World Tree has somehow become even stronger? Bly: We should try climbing it to find out!
0x124E9|Clift: If possible, I wouldn't want to come here again... Sigh... But I can't help it.
0x124EA|Alina: ``I prefer eggs that are well-roasted.'' Alina: ``But I think chicken tastes better when it's slowly grilled.
0x124EB|Torneko: "This is the World Tree, right? That's what I saw in the picture back then. Hmm, I'm looking forward to it! I'm looking forward to it!
0x124EC|Minea: ``...The atmosphere is different. Minea: I understand. Something is happening at the World Tree. Yes, something very important.
0x124ED|Manya: Isn't this where the chickens said something good will happen? Manya: If they're lying, I'll punish them!
0x124EE|Alina: “The World Tree is so convenient. I want one for my castle too. I wonder if I could take it home.
0x124EF|Minea: ``If you have the power of the World Tree, there's nothing to fear!'' Hehe, that's good too.
0x124F0|Ryan: ``I've never been interested in flowers, but if they're that beautiful, I'd like to see them at least once.''
0x124F1|Clift: ``It's so creepy to think of a flower that blooms only once every thousand years.'' Torneko: ``That elf. Have you ever seen a flower that blooms only once every thousand years?'' Torneko: ``You look quite young, but how old are you really?
0x124F2|Manya: ``I am blessed with both beauty and dancing talent. I am a once-in-a-millennium talent!''
0x124F3|Bligh: Hmm. What about the flower of the World Tree? I've never heard of anything like that.
0x124F4|Alina: ``If it's a tree this big, the flowers must be big too! It looks like it could hold about the size of a cow.''
0x124F5|Minea: The flower of the World Tree... What kind of miracle will it cause?
0x124F6|Lucia: “I’m really grateful to everyone. Thank you very much!
0x124F7|Ryan: ``It hurts my heart that I couldn't eradicate all the monsters in the World Tree, but I can't help it.''
0x124F8|Bly: It feels so good to help a young girl. Bly: What's more, receiving the respect of another young girl! It feels even better. Hmm.
0x124F9|Clift: "It's the priest's job to help those in trouble. I understand that. That's right. I have to go help them. Clift: "...But you don't have to worry about being at the top of such a tall tree! Wow!
0x124FA|Alina: ``Blye also has good ears for someone of her age. She doesn't miss a bad word!'' Alina: ``Maybe Blye is from an elf family? Hmm, isn't her appearance too good?
0x124FB|Torneko: ``If you want to sell to this village, earpicks might be a good idea. Hmm, I think they'll sell well!
0x124FC|Lucia: “Did you even hear my voice this far!? It might be embarrassing.
0x124FD|Bligh: Yes, we wouldn't be in trouble even if many people fell down from the sky.
0x124FE|Manya: ``Ah, ah. If only it had been a good man who was asking for help.'' Manya: ``Then it would have been a little more fun, like having lovey-dovey with the lifesaver.''
0x124FF|Ryan: Is someone calling for help from above the tree? Let's go check it out!
0x12500|Clift: ...That's right. If I were to climb up a tree, I'd prefer to climb in a horse-drawn carriage if possible... Clift: "No... if you insist, I'll climb up a tree... Ugh.
0x12501|Arena: "Can you hear people's voices? That sounds interesting. Let's climb! Climb!
0x12502|. Gagame ``Seeds''
0x12503|! Rahoso! Is it China? Maybe a spirit that doesn't respond is calling out to those people. I have to be careful. Minea: If you reply carelessly, a spirit may follow you.
0x12504|Clift: It is said that the leaves of the World Tree have a power comparable to the prayers of a virtuous priest.
0x12505|Alina: Once upon a time, when I had a cold, Bligh made me drink some strange leaves.
0x12506|Manya: “I wonder if the leaves of the World Tree have a skin-beautifying effect?
0x12507|Bligh: When this old man was little, the World Tree was still the size of an ordinary tree. Bligh: ...I was listening to all of your jokes! I don't understand the joke at all!!
0x12508|Minea: “Shadow of trees and sun. I love dark places...hehe.”
0x12509|Torneko: ``The fox spoke! What if we're turned into foxes again!?''
0x1250A|Manya: “That tail... It looks perfect for my collar.
0x1250B|Rosalie: Not all monsters have evil hearts... No, it's nothing.
0x1250C|Alina: “I wonder if monsters will stop appearing if the world becomes peaceful. That would be sad.
0x1250D|Torneko: If that's the case, you can make a lot of money by selling weapons and armor in this village now. Hmm.
0x1250E|Minea: ``Let's restore peace to the world as soon as possible. For everyone in this village.''
0x1250F|Rosalie: ``It's been a while. It's been a long time since I met my elf friends. I miss it so much.''
0x12510|Lucia: We are very close to the sky people and the elves! Lucia: We also have some elf friends living in the castle in the sky.
0x12511|Clift: Elves are a mysterious race. They don't often show themselves to humans.
0x12512|Manya: ``It would be nice to wear something similar to my daughter's costume for the next stage.
0x12513|Panon: The World Tree is the tallest in the world! Panon: Yeah, it's the royal road!
0x12514|Lucia: Thank you for helping me! Lucia: Please take me to the castle in the sky.
0x12515|Ryan: Old man, animal elf. Hmm, I can't believe there aren't any decent men, let alone soldiers. Ryan: Even though it's protected by a rocky mountain, it's a very careless village.
0x12516|Bligh: "It repeats the annual rings and brings everyone together. That reliable figure. A sense of presence. Hmm. It's like looking at yourself.
0x12517|Clift: ``...It's such a tall tree that you can clearly see it from a balloon. Even if it doesn't grow that much...'' Clift: ``I think things are beautiful in moderation after all...'' Sigh... It's cold.
0x12518|Alina: ``Why don't we compete to see who can climb to the top of that tree the fastest?It will also help you get fit!
0x12519|Toruneko: ``A trip around the World Tree in a balloon!...That might be a good plan.'' Toruneko: ``No, I've been thinking about starting a company called Toruneko Travel Agency based on the experience of this trip.''
0x1251A|Minea: "It's a mysterious village. Humans, elves, and animals all live happily together..." Minea: "Is this also the power of that tree?
0x1251B|Manya: ``Hey, it's a huge tree. Why don't you carve your name into the trunk as a souvenir? Isn't that a bad idea?
0x1251C|Torneko: ``Okay, I asked you! I'll be waiting for you in the port town.''
0x1251D|Torneko: A holy flame was burning in this lighthouse not long ago. Torneko: And it seems that the pilot of that flame is still somewhere in this lighthouse. Torneko: "If you use the holy pilot, the evil flames should go out too! The first thing you need to do is look for the holy pilot. Torneko: Shall I say that again?
0x1251E|Torneko: “Oh! Thank you!
0x1251F|Torneko: Don't say that, do something about it! Please!
0x12520|Torneko: "Oh! I don't know who you are, but you've come to the right place! Torneko: I came this far with the intention of extinguishing the evil flames burning in this lighthouse, but... Torneko: The monsters were so strong that I couldn't go any further. Torneko: Please! Could you extinguish the evil flames for me?
0x12521|Torneko: ``It was at this lighthouse that I met <HERO> and the others for the first time. Torneko: ``At that time, I came here by myself, and I was really sad.
0x12522|Lucia: "Hmm. This is a lighthouse. I see." Lucia: "By the way, what is a lighthouse?
0x12523|Panon: ``Let's have a battle at the Great Lighthouse!''...It's common, but you're well organized.
0x12524|Hoffman: I clearly remember fighting the monsters and lighting the sacred flame here. Hoffman: After all, it was my first time doing something like that. Traveling with everyone gives me a lot of experiences.
0x12525|Minea: When I come here, I remember when Mr. Torneko forced us to exterminate monsters. Minea: I think the impression we make when we first meet someone is quite important.
0x12526|Manya: Come to think of it, there's a delicious monster in this lighthouse. What the heck...it's meta somehow... Manya: It's annoying when you run away, but it's exciting when you defeat it.
0x12527|Bligh: It's said that there was once a monster named Lighthouse Tiger in this lighthouse. Bligh: Lighthouse Tiger...what a direct name!
0x12528|Clift: It's a lighthouse that lights up the port of Conanberry, so it's really big. Clift: It's so big, I feel like I'll get lost... Sigh... I hate towers.
0x12529|Alina: Right after we set sail from Conanberry, this lighthouse was lit by a dark flame, right? Alina: If I had been there then, I could have done something about it. What a shame.
0x1252A|Ryan: ``It's a truly magnificent lighthouse. That's why it's such a shame that it's now a home for monsters.''
0x1252B|Hoffman: Now ships can now depart from Conanberry. Hoffman: The next step is to travel by boat.Where in the world should we start?
0x1252C|Minea: I'm concerned about Conan Berry's situation.Would you like to leave here quickly?
0x1252D|Manya: Come on! Let's hurry back to Conanberry. Manya: A fun cruise awaits us!
0x1252E|Hoffman: That's the great merchant Torneko... It's not what I imagined.
0x1252F|Minea: ``You forced trouble on us without asking. Minea: ``As expected, you are a rumored great merchant. You must not let your guard down.
0x12530|Manya: ``Torneko was a very light-hearted man for someone so rich.'' Manya: ``He seems to be heavy, so he doesn't have to go out much. I've been prepared for this much ever since we went on a trip with everyone.''
0x12531|Minea: It's hard to believe that this was once a lighthouse that protected the safety of boaters. Minea: Is this evil presence caused by the flames of darkness?
0x12532|Manya: ``It's a dark and depressing tower. I want to quickly accomplish my purpose and leave this place.''
0x12533|Torneko: ``It was at this lighthouse that I met <HERO> and the others for the first time. Torneko: ``At that time, I came here by myself, and I was really sad.

0x126C6|Torneko: ``It was at this lighthouse that I met <HERO> and the others for the first time. Torneko: ``At that time, I came here by myself, and I was really sad.
0x126C7|Lucia: "Hmm. This is a lighthouse. I see." Lucia: "By the way, what is a lighthouse?
0x126C8|Panon: ``Let's have a battle at the Great Lighthouse!''...It's common, but you're well organized.
0x126C9|Hoffman: I clearly remember fighting the monsters and lighting the sacred flame here. Hoffman: After all, it was my first time doing something like that. Traveling with everyone gives me a lot of experiences.
0x126CA|Minea: When I come here, I remember when Mr. Torneko forced us to exterminate monsters. Minea: I think the impression we make when we first meet someone is quite important.
0x126CB|Manya: Come to think of it, there's a delicious monster in this lighthouse. What the heck...it's meta somehow... Manya: It's annoying when you run away, but it's exciting when you defeat it.
0x126CC|Bligh: It's said that there was once a monster named Lighthouse Tiger in this lighthouse. Bligh: Lighthouse Tiger...what a direct name!
0x126CD|Clift: It's a lighthouse that lights up the port of Conanberry, so it's really big. Clift: It's so big, I feel like I'll get lost... Sigh... I hate towers.
0x126CE|Alina: Right after we set sail from Conanberry, this lighthouse was lit by a dark flame, right? Alina: If I had been there then, I could have done something about it. What a shame.
0x126CF|Ryan: ``It's a truly magnificent lighthouse. That's why it's such a shame that it's now a home for monsters.''
0x126D0|Hoffman: Now, a ship from Conan Berry.
0x126D1|Ga Hoffman: ``The next step is to travel by boat.Where in the world should we start?''
0x126D2|Minea: I'm concerned about Conan Berry's situation.Would you like to leave here quickly?
0x126D3|Manya: Come on! Let's hurry back to Conanberry. Manya: A fun cruise awaits us!
0x126D4|Hoffman: Now, with the holy torch, let's free this lighthouse from the hands of the monsters.
0x126D5|Minea: I'm sure the monsters couldn't touch the sacred pilot fire and couldn't do anything about it. Minea: Otherwise, there's no way the pilot would have been left in such a conspicuous place.
0x126D6|Manya: ``Is this the sacred spark? Even a monster would be careless to leave you alone in a place like this.''
0x126D7|Hoffman: ``There's nothing to be scared of. I've been prepared for this much since I set out on this journey with you all.''
0x126D8|Minea: It's hard to believe that this was once a lighthouse that protected the safety of boaters. Minea: Is this evil presence caused by the flames of darkness?
0x126D9|Manya: ``It's a dark and depressing tower. I want to quickly accomplish my purpose and leave this place.''
0x126DA|The evil flame disappeared and the holy flame began to shine!
0x126DB|Lucia lights the sacred flame. Denoshi Minea!
0x126DC|Kekekeke. He's an idiot for coming this far. Just right! Of this flame. I'll make you feel like a bastard! Kekekeke.
0x126DD|yeah? Who is it? ?
0x126DE|Kekeke. Burn, burn. By the light of the evil flame, all the animals! Ko: “What a small postcard...”
0x126DF|Torneko: “This light
0x126E0|That's where I met <HERO> and others for the first time. Torneko: ``I was so sad when I got burned by that light.''
0x126E1|Lucia: “Huh. There’s a light here.
0x126E2|That's right. I see. Lucia: “By the way, light.
0x126E3|What is that?
0x126E4|Panon “Shisokonho”
0x126E5|It's rare... but it's common, but it's a well-organized person.
0x126E6|HOFFMAN: I clearly remember fighting the monsters and lighting the sacred flame here. HOFFMAN: Well, it's the first time you've ever done something like that.
0x126E7|hey. Traveling with everyone will give you a variety of experiences.
0x126E8|Minea: When I come here, I remember when Mr. Torneko forced us to exterminate monsters. Minea: I think the impression we make when we first meet someone is quite important.
0x126E9|Manya: “Now that I think about it, the light here is
0x126EA|There are delicious monsters in there, right? What the heck...somehow meta... Manya: ``If Teru, who ran away from home, defeats him, he'll be happy.''
0x126EB|Bligh: Once upon a time, this light
0x126EC|There is a light
0x126ED|Apparently there was a monster named Tiger. Bly ``Light''
0x126EE|Tiger... What a direct name!
0x126EF|Clift: Lighting up the port of Conanberry
0x126F0|Light
0x126F1|As you might expect, it's pretty cool. Clift: ``I really...I feel like I'm going to get lost...'' Sigh...I hate towers.
0x126F2|Alina: Are we Conanberry?
0x126F3|Immediately after this light shines
0x126F4|A dark flame was lit, right? Alina: ``That's right. If I had turned around, I could have done something about it. It's a shame.''
0x126F5|Ryan: “Really nice light.
0x126F6|That's right. That's why I regret that it has become a home for monsters.
0x126F7|Hoffman: Is this Conan Berry?
0x126F8|Now you can talk. Hoffman: “Finally, the next one is Nodere. Going out into the world!?”
0x126F9|Shall we go around?
0x126FA|Minea: I've noticed Conanberry's condition. I'll be here soon.
0x126FB|Would you like to leave?
0x126FC|Manya: Come on! Let's hurry back to Conanberry. Manya: We're waiting for you to have some fun!
0x126FD|Hoffman: ``Wow...'' Well, you did it somehow.
0x126FE|It was a tough battle.
0x126FF|Minea: <HERO>-san, please don't forget that there is still work left to do here.
0x12700|Manya: “Hmph. He’s not even close to a mouthful.”
0x12701|hey. He wasn't my enemy. Manya: ``Now, let's go home. ... Huh? Were you doing something here?
0x12702|Hoffman: ``There's nothing to be scared of.
0x12703|Inoko: I'm prepared.
0x12704|Minea: “This used to be Nokokairi.
0x12705|Zenona
0x12706|Nona
0x12707|I believe that
0x12708|I don't think so. Minea: “Is it because of this evil flame of darkness?
0x12709|Manya: ``It's dark and painful. I want to quickly accomplish my purpose and leave this place.''

0x12715|Torneko: “Wow, I was surprised. No way.
0x12716|A strange secret... with a strong arena... Torneko: ``It's a world where we really have to be careful.
0x12717|Bly: “That’s completely outrageous! San!
0x12718|I will treat the world as a thief! Bligh: If this is the world, then this is an international problem.
0x12719|Clift: ``God is always watching over us.'' Clift: ``Don't worry, the song against us will be solved soon.''
0x1271A|Alina: ``I wasn't there. But the Queen believed in us.'' Alina: ``In order to live up to that trust, we have to find Masato!
0x1271B|Ryan: ``Now that it's getting worse, we need to catch Masato as soon as possible. Now, let's go!
0x1271C|Minea: My fortune-telling says that people fled to the south. Minea: Come on, <HERO>-san. Let's head south.
0x1271D|“Gardenburg… Gardenburg….
0x1271E|``Ah! That's a good gag.'' Manya: ``That's totally disgusting! Why would we steal a cross?'' Manya: ``If this happens, I'll have to take my anger out on the real culprit!''
0x1271F|Torneko: “Oh no, I was surprised.
0x12720|Kuichie Manya: ``To be forced to wear something like that...'' Toruneko: ``This is a world where you really have to be careful.
0x12721|``It's completely outrageous! To think that a party including the Princess of Santheim would be treated as thieves!

0x128A3|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x128A4|It is a statue of a dragon that shines in gold.
0x128A5|Acha~. When I was smoking outside, the castle gate was closed. So I guess I have no choice but to stay up here tonight. ...sigh, I can't keep up.
0x128A6|At night, they close the castle because they are not careful. Please come back tomorrow morning.
0x128A7|Didn't you see the suspicious man? Now that I think about it, a strange guy who looks like a poet ran off to the south.
0x128A8|No smoking is allowed inside the castle, so I go outside and smoke. Actually, I wish I could quit smoking...
0x128A9|Phew. The cigarettes are delicious...
0x128AA|This is a castle where only women live. My queen is very beautiful.
0x128AB|Welcome to the castle of Gardenburg. It has been many years since we had customers from outside.
0x128AC|Manya: It's such an inconvenient country that you can't enter at night. Manya: My points for Gardenburg have definitely gone down.
0x128AD|Ryan: ``As expected of a castle for women only. It's tough in a place like this.''
0x128AE|Clift: "If that's the plan, then I can't help it. Mr. HERO, let's say you come in the morning.
0x128AF|Minea: ``I thought it would be a more closed country, but it was surprisingly welcoming.'' Minea: ``Well, I was accused of being a thief, but that was also thoughtless...''
0x128B0|Torneko: I'm surprised that you've cut off contact with the outside world for so many years, even though it's because the road was blocked.
0x128B1|Bligh: If we hadn't created a path with our magma wands, we might never have had any visitors from outside. Bligh: If you think about it that way, I think you should be more grateful.
0x128B2|Alina: Looks like no one has ever visited this country after us. Alina: I wonder if word has spread that the roads are connected yet?
0x128B3|Lucia: "Is this a castle only for women? Come to think of it, there are a lot of women here." Lucia: "I wouldn't have noticed it at all unless you told me.
0x128B4|Panon: "Gardenburg... Gardenburg..." Panon: "Ah! There's a good gag here!
0x128B5|Manya: ``That's a cool castle. After all, a building built with a woman's sense is different.''
0x128B6|Torneko: ``This country is a nice place, but I just wish it would be better not to end up in prison.''
0x128B7|Bligh: ``When it comes to Toshi, I'm not particularly happy when I hear that it's an all-female castle.Bligh: In fact, it just brings back unpleasant memories of me being forced to wear Nureginu.''
0x128B8|Clift: ``As expected from a women-only castle.It's a beautiful, well-kept garden.
0x128B9|Alina: ``Gardenburg turned out to be a wonderful country, just as I expected.'' Alina: ``Well, I was mistaken for a thief, but that's a fond memory.
0x128BA|Ryan: ``The castle's defenses remain strong and it doesn't lose its elegance, so it's quite a beautiful castle.
0x128BB|Minea: ``What I learned in this country is not to look into other people's drawers unnecessarily...'' Minea: ``...No matter what you say, there's no way <HERO> will give up so easily.'' Minea: ``It's fine. I've already given up.
0x128BC|Minea: “I knew it! My fortune-telling also says that the culprit fled to the south.
0x128BD|Torneko: But if you think about it calmly, the only way to get out of this castle is to head south.
0x128BE|Bligh: ``I don't think there's anything nice about a really nasty guy.''
0x128BF|Ryan: ``Oh, that guy must be the real culprit! <HERO>Where are we going south?
0x128C0|Manya: It's such an inconvenient country that you can't enter at night. Manya: My points for Gardenburg have definitely gone down.
0x128C1|Ryan: ``As expected of a castle for women only. It's tough in a place like this.''
0x128C2|Clift: "If that's the plan, then I can't help it. Mr. HERO, let's say you come in the morning.

0x128C4|Torneko: I'm surprised that you've cut off contact with the outside world for so many years, even though it's because the road was blocked.
0x128C5|Bligh: If we don't create a path with our magma wands, we won't be able to attract guests from outside. Bligh: If you think about it that way, I think you should be more grateful.
0x128C6|Arena: ``It's natural since we paved the way for ourselves, but it's an honor to have been a customer for several years.
0x128C7|Panon: "Gardenburg... Gardenburg..." Panon: "Ah! There's a good gag here!
0x128C8|Manya: That's disgusting! Why would we steal a cross? Manya: If this happens, I'll have to take out my anger on the real culprit!
0x128C9|Toruneko: ``Wow, I was surprised. I never thought I'd be able to dress up as a thief.'' Toruneko: ``This is a world where you really have to be careful.
0x128CA|Bligh: That's completely outrageous! I can't believe that a party that includes the Princess of Santheim would be treated like a thief! Bligh: If this is the world, then this is an international issue.
0x128CB|Clift: ``God is always watching over us.'' Clift: ``Don't worry, the song against us will be solved soon.''
0x128CC|Alina: ``I wasn't following you. But the Queen believed in us.'' Alina: ``In order to live up to that trust, we have to find the real culprit!
0x128CD|Ryan: ``We need to catch the real culprit as soon as possible. Now, let's go!
0x128CE|Minea: My fortune-telling says that the culprit fled to the south. Minea: Come on, <HERO>-san. Let's head south.
0x128CF|Panon: "Gardenburg... Gardenburg..." Panon: "Ah! There's a good gag here!
0x128D0|Minea: Oh? I just did a fortune telling about us and it showed signs of trouble for women. Minea: I have a bad feeling that women will be in trouble in this country.
0x128D1|Manya: ``That's a cool castle. After all, a building built with a woman's sense is different.''
0x128D2|Torneko: "Is this a castle only for women? Hmm. It's kind of creepy, isn't it?
0x128D3|Bligh: ``When it comes to Toshi, I'm not particularly happy when I hear that it's a castle for women only.Bligh: If anything, I'm even worried that I might get involved in some kind of disaster.''
0x128D4|Clift: ``As expected from a women-only castle.It's a beautiful, well-kept garden.
0x128D5|Alina: The soldier at the castle gate is really a woman. This is Gardenburg!
0x128D6|Ryan: ``The castle's defenses remain strong and it doesn't lose its elegance, so it's quite a beautiful castle.

0x12A56|Acha~. When I was smoking outside, the castle gate was closed. So I guess I have no choice but to stay up here tonight. ...sigh, I can't keep up.
0x12A57|At night, they close the castle because they are not careful. Please come back tomorrow morning.
0x12A58|Didn't you see the suspicious man? Now that I think about it, a strange guy who looks like a poet ran off to the south.
0x12A59|No smoking is allowed inside the castle, so I go outside and smoke. Actually, I wish I could quit smoking...
0x12A5A|Phew. The cigarettes are delicious...
0x12A5B|This is a castle where only women live. My queen is very beautiful.
0x12A5C|Welcome to the castle of Gardenburg. It has been many years since we had customers from outside.
0x12A5D|Manya: It's such an inconvenient country that you can't enter at night. Manya: My points for Gardenburg have definitely gone down.
0x12A5E|Ryan: ``As expected of a castle for women only. It's tough in a place like this.''
0x12A5F|Clift: "If that's the plan, then I can't help it. Mr. HERO, let's say you come in the morning.
0x12A60|Minea: ``I thought it would be a more closed country, but it was surprisingly welcoming.'' Minea: ``Well, I was accused of being a thief, but that was also thoughtless...''
0x12A61|Torneko: I'm surprised that you've cut off contact with the outside world for so many years, even though it's because the road was blocked.
0x12A62|Bligh: If we hadn't created a path with our magma wands, we might never have had any visitors from outside. Bligh: If you think about it that way, I think you should be more grateful.
0x12A63|Alina: Looks like no one has ever visited this country after us. Alina: I wonder if word has spread that the roads are connected yet?
0x12A64|Lucia: "Is this a castle only for women? Come to think of it, there are a lot of women here." Lucia: "I wouldn't have noticed it at all unless you told me.
0x12A65|Panon: "Gardenburg... Gardenburg..." Panon: "Ah! There's a good gag here!
0x12A66|Manya: ``That's a cool castle. After all, a building built with a woman's sense is different.''
0x12A67|Torneko: ``This country is a nice place, but I just wish it would be better not to end up in prison.''
0x12A68|Bligh: ``When it comes to Toshi, I'm not particularly happy when I hear that it's an all-female castle.Bligh: In fact, it just brings back unpleasant memories of me being forced to wear Nureginu.''

0x12A6A|Alina: ``Gardenburg turned out to be a wonderful country, just as I expected.'' Alina: ``Well, I was mistaken for a thief, but that's a fond memory.
0x12A6B|Ryan: ``The castle's defenses remain strong and it doesn't lose its elegance, so it's quite a beautiful castle.

0x12A6D|Minea: “I knew it! My fortune-telling also says that the culprit fled to the south.
0x12A6E|Torneko: But if you think about it calmly, the only way to get out of this castle is to head south.
0x12A6F|Bligh: ``I don't think there's anything nice about a really nasty guy.''
0x12A70|Ryan: ``Oh, that guy must be the real culprit! <HERO>Where are we going south?

0x12A7B|Bligh: That's completely outrageous! I can't believe that a party that includes the Princess of Santheim would be treated like a thief! Bligh: If this is the world, then this is an international issue.

0x12A87|picture? What? Did you catch the real culprit? That was good. Keep up the good work!
0x12A88|The bronze cross was returned to us by the Queen. However, even for a moment, I admired you guys... I still don't have the qualifications to preach to people...
0x12A89|It's outrageous to steal inside a castle! I can't escape anymore! Come on!
0x12A8A|...Oh no, it's my bronze cross! ? someone! Thief! Someone’s coming!
0x12A8B|You guys! what are you doing here?
0x12A8C|Hey hello! Please check inside the closet. There's some interesting stuff in there.
0x12A8D|bean paste? What? Where are the thieves likely to hide? Well, if it were me, I'd probably hide in a cave.
0x12A8E|bean paste? What? I'm busy right now.
0x12A8F|I like strong men, no matter what kind of man they are. A man strong enough to defeat me... Pop.
0x12A90|The Emperor of Hell is a man. If so, wouldn't it be too sweet for girls?
0x12A91|It looks like the Emperor of Hell will finally be resurrected! I wonder what the legendary hero who was supposed to defeat the emperor is doing?
0x12A92|fault? A traveler! Does that mean the blocked road is back to normal? Oh good! Ever since that area was blocked, it's been inconvenient and I can't help it.
0x12A93|We had them buy weapons and armor for women, and they said, ``It's going to be a disaster...'' and I can't go back home... Huh? We're on our way? Hmm, I feel happy, but I feel sad...
0x12A94|That bronze cross is my treasure. Please give it back!
0x12A95|I have dedicated everything to God and preached to others. This was recognized by the Queen and she received a bronze cross. It's a treasure more important than life itself!
0x12A96|I'm the only man living in this castle. Fuho, fuho, aren't you jealous? Now...
0x12A97|Don't look at it thinking it's a castle only for women. We, the warriors who strengthen our defense, will not lose to men!
0x12A98|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x12A99|Clift: ``Does the princess still like strong men? Clift: ``But I can't possibly defeat the princess.'' Clift: ``...Even better, if Zaki can use it...
0x12A9A|Alina: Yeah, I guess I like strong guys too. Alina: But if he's stronger than me, I might feel embarrassed and not want to fight.
0x12A9B|Ryan: ``Oh, I've been waiting for a line like this! I have to show her my strength!''
0x12A9C|Bligh: But if you think about it, where are the rumors about the resurrection of the Emperor of Hell coming from?
0x12A9D|Manya: Hey <HERO>. Why don't you just tell him that the hero in front of him is that hero? Manya: I'm sure he'll be surprised.
0x12A9E|Clift: No matter how legendary the hero is, it's impossible to defeat someone who hasn't even revived yet. Clift: Let's do what we can without rushing.
0x12A9F|Ryan: However, if you don't do what I say, you might be forced to quickly defeat the Emperor of Hell.Ryan: There's no way you'll poke at a bush and bring out a snake.Let's just stay quiet here.
0x12AA0|Ryan: Well, if you're saying that to <HERO>, let's keep it a secret. I feel like it's a little annoying though.
0x12AA1|Ryan: Is it no good to say that the legendary hero is here?
0x12AA2|Minea: Even though you say that, there's no sign of you leaving. Minea: How long do you plan on staying in this castle?
0x12AA3|Manya: Are you a merchant who specializes in women's weapons and armor? Manya: Could you sell it to me cheaply if I just give it to you?
0x12AA4|Toruneko: ``I see. Women's items are essential for doing business in this country.'' Toruneko: ``That's a really useful story. I'll make a note of it.
0x12AA5|Ryan: ``I feel bad and jealous that I couldn't return home from this country for so many years...''
0x12AA6|Manya: "Thanks to you, we had a terrible experience. Manya: ...Well, even if I were that sister, she would have praised us.
0x12AA7|Alina: ``I feel sorry for you for being so depressed.Everyone makes mistakes.''
0x12AA8|Clift: No matter how good a sister is, she will still make mistakes as a human being. Clift: But isn't it really important that you don't repeat the mistakes you made?
0x12AA9|Ryan: Well, it's true that we acted in a way that deserved praise. Ryan: It can't be helped that we were mistaken for the culprit. You can't hold a grudge against that sister.
0x12AAA|Manya: “But no matter how strong you are, I don’t think it’s a good idea to have muscular muscles.
0x12AAB|Bligh: ``That's not an opinion I'd want a princess to hear. Bligh: Well, you've come to a really troublesome country.
0x12AAC|Clift: I thought princesses were special, but it seems I was wrong.
0x12AAD|Alina: "That person is right. Just because you're a woman doesn't mean you're bad at fighting!

0x12FE9|Minea: The previous King Batland was a lewd person. Minea: Blood is something that can be passed down. I'm sure the current king is also a lewd person.

0x1300D|Even one step through
0x1300E|Don't do it! here
0x1300F|Butland's castle. Grrrr... tonight
0x13010|Stay at an inn
0x13011|Tomorrow
0x13012|I hope you come. Ninotoko
0x13013|Gosa. Kanaho out here
0x13014|It's the castle's treasure house. Even if I open the key? What are you hearing?
0x13015|Put it on the back
0x13016|stomach! It's a bit annoying, but I'm wandering around everywhere and slowing down as usual.
0x13017|That's right. Oh no, no. I heard you...Pops. Ryan
0x13018|I wonder how things are going these days? I'm worried.... Oh Ryan
0x13019|in
0x1301A|Oh! ? I hope you are safe.
0x1301B|Between. I'm always you
0x1301C|I wish you safe travels.

0x1301E|I wonder what they'll do if they steal something... in
0x1301F|After listening
0x13020|Please come. But how on earth could the dragon god in the sky
0x13021|Should I meet...? Daiichi God
0x13022|So even if you don't go out of your way to inform them, they probably already know. Listen to the old man in the room next door.
0x13023|Did you? Hmm! I finally got it! Emperor of Hell. Apparently it's a monster that has achieved the ultimate evolution! But the dragon god in the sky
0x13024|But that's it
0x13025|Surprised by the amazingness of the water, it was sealed underground... Apparently, the Emperor of Hell will somehow come back to life. The dragon god
0x13026|I have to let you know as soon as possible.
0x13027|God of the resting dragon
0x13028|What about the ultimate evolution?
0x13029|So much for that old man's nonsense.
0x1302A|It's a problem. I heard that once upon a time, in this castle
0x1302B|It is said that there was a shield in the sky. Come to think of it, the helmet in the sky
0x1302C|In the western sea of ​​Stansiala, there was a machete. ``I wonder if I can find out...''
0x1302D|I'm a soldier.
0x1302E|Yano oi meruzao! Ryan, how are you doing?
0x1302F|Several generations. I don't think Ryan cares about anything...
0x13030|...What do I do?
0x13031|I'll put it on top of this
0x13032|vinegar. It was written as ``History of Butland.'' It's in the middle of the day. {7f4b}
0x13033|I picked it up and read it. Batrea, the founder of Batland
0x13034|He protected Batland from monsters at the time, when it was just a village. At that time, with the shield given to me by the god of heaven, Batrea
0x13035|It is said that it protected itself from all kinds of attacks from monsters... Minea: ``There are people who gain superiority by putting others down.''
0x13036|Ryan: Is that okay? Don't let me say things like that! Manya: That's it!
0x13037|It's better to just say it once and do it.
0x13038|You're slowing me down
0x13039|You're handling it... You look dull.
0x1303A|Is it water? Minea: “What happened between Mr. Ryan and that woman? Deeply.”
0x1303B|pursue
0x1303C|Senwa. Manya: ``Ryan, I'll do it! You're such a sexy man! A woman killer~! Torneko: ``Hmm. Mr. Ryan, it's hard to put him in the corner.
0x1303D|Sorry. Ryan: Gohon, gohon! Ah, with that lady.
0x1303E|That's right...
0x1303F|Ah, how can I say it...Gonyogonyo. Manya: I want a golden bracelet too. Even monsters can become shiny objects.
0x13040|You don't have eyes. Torneko: "Hmm. What a waste. Did you mean to say something so disgusting?" Bri: "Golden bracelet!? At that time.
0x13041|I'm sure it's a princess
0x13042|A fake has appeared. . Setana. Bligh: Wow! Even remembering it now makes me nervous! Clift: That's certainly a strange story. What if that bracelet...
0x13043|Was there some kind of secret? Alina: What about the golden bracelet from that Frenor incident? Alina: Hmm. This inn. Looks like something's wrong with you. Manya: After listening to it.
0x13044|He's such a great guy to come here. Bly: Hmm. I wish you would treat me with a little more love. Minea:
0x13045|Even though he doesn't mind forcing anything on me... Manya: “There you are, the dragon god.”
0x13046|to all
0x13047|You can rest assured if you leave it alone. Manya: “That’s why...
0x13048|Shall we go? In the first place, I am a person.
0x13049|It's not just my nature.
0x1304A|It is Almighty. Tonanata
0x1304B|Na Loso
0x1304C|Hands on. Clift: ``However, I went to the sky to find out who the soldiers were.''
0x1304D|I have to go

0x1304F|stomach. Arena “Dragon God”
0x13050|I wonder if it's strong after all? I'd like to try it out sometime! Ryan: ``Where is <HERO>! Where are you? Don't make me feel anxious.'' ``Sea urchin, dragon!''
0x13051|I'm sorry for asking such a rude question.
0x13052|I didn't. Ryan “<HERO>
0x13053|Waka Tasu. Do you remember if you were looking for equipment in the sky?
0x13054|What? Minea: “...The ultimate evolution...
0x13055|or
0x13056|Is it related to the research that my father was doing? Minea: “I have a bad feeling.
0x13057|vinegar. Manya: ``That's an outrageous story! Isn't that old man looking for attention? Torneko:
0x13058|a. That dragon god
0x13059|If you ask him, he will dress like the Emperor of Hell.
0x1305A|! It's so cheap right now, it's so hot right now
0x1305B|I was so worried about the ultimate evolution.
0x1305C|What kind of thing is it...? I feel like I'd like to take a look
0x1305D|Suna. Clift: “Why is the Emperor of Hell resurrected?
0x1305E|Is this a plan by demons? Arena “God
0x1305F|I can't believe I'm so surprised...
0x13060|Tanoke? I want to fight you once! Ryan: ``Hmm. That was an incredible story. Ryan: ``But...
0x13061|I now know that what I just said is true.
0x13062|vinegar. We must reach the sky as soon as possible! Torneko: The sword of the sky that I desire
0x13063|Where is it?
0x13064|I have a good idea
0x13065|Sorry. Bligh: What do you think of my Santheim? Is there one or two hidden treasures?
0x13066|Sure. Bligh: Well...I think I've collected a lot of Ninoto's canes from several generations ago.
0x13067|figure……. Clift: “As expected of the equipment of the sky.
0x13068|It's so valuable that it becomes a treasure. Arena: ``The equipment of the sky seems to be affecting the mood in various places.But in my house.
0x13069|There wasn't. Ryan: Listen to something important.
0x1306A|I did. As expected of a Batland soldier.
0x1306B|Not only is he good at fighting, but he is also knowledgeable. Panon: “Batland’s ni-no-to! Al-arina-and!…hehehe.”
0x1306C|Kudeki
0x1306D|I'm sorry.
0x1306E|...The statue of Clift was placed in the investigation.
0x1306F|Does it have some magical meaning? Manya: ``Oh, it's a surprisingly nice castle. I was imagining something more rugged and cumbersome.'' Torneko: ``Thank you for this castle.''
0x13070|It looks like there are a lot of soldiers and guards. Torneko: ``I think we can do good business in this country after all.'' Bly: ``Compared to my castle in Santheim, this castle is a little lacking in elegance.Bly:''
0x13071|Oh, it's a child... It's probably the limit of a warrior nation. debt
0x13072|……. Clift: This castle
0x13073|It seems that there is no church within the castle. That's unfortunate. Arena: Since there are so many warriors, isn't there a training ground somewhere? Ryan: The nostalgic Castle of Butland! Before I set out on my journey...
0x13074|He served this castle. Ryan: Of course, my loyalty remains.
0x13075|You can enter the castle, but you can't meet the king. It's the night's routine.
0x13076|Do you need something from the king? But if it's not urgent, I'd like you to do it tomorrow. Since the king is busy during the day, I want him to take a good rest at night.
0x13077|The gates of my Butland are open to guests from other countries. Please pass by.
0x13078|Who do you think it is, Ryan? Please pass by.
0x13079|Heh...heh...hekushi! ...Ugh. It's a bit too cold a day to be a gatekeeper.
0x1307A|Manya: I've been thinking this for a while, but not being able to enter the throne room at night is bad service.
0x1307B|Ryan: It's true that King Butland is a busy man. Ryan: What about <HERO>? Let's meet the king again tomorrow.
0x1307C|Good night....
0x1307D|Hmmm. I feel like I need to pee... But it's scary to go alone.
0x1307E|I'm staying home alone! That's great! I'm not a child anymore.
0x1307F|I have already closed the store today. If you want anything, please come back tomorrow.
0x13080|Oh? Are you shopping? If so, please go outside the store and talk to me behind the counter.
0x13081|Even monsters can't get into a town where there are a lot of people. If the rumors say that the Emperor of Hell has been resurrected, then I can't say that... ... Bulbul. I was getting scared when I said it myself.

0x1337F|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x13380|It's an old but well-maintained organ. It must have been important for many years.
0x13381|Kisha!
0x13382|...Ugh. I want to be able to sleep in a house that protects me from the rain as soon as possible.
0x13383|If it was the village of Imuru, we would have to go through the cave to the west of the castle.
0x13384|If you walk northeast, you will reach
0x13385|Masuwa.
0x13386|This is the castle town of Butland.
0x13387|As expected. No, I'm sorry I had to go out of my way.
0x13388|Hahaha...I'm out of breath... After all, it's hard for the elderly. Please go without worrying.
0x13389|Is it true! ? Let's follow along! By the way, I'm not good at combat. It won't be of any use to you, so don't think so.
0x1338A|When I was young, I also admired being a warrior in the royal palace. This old man wants to help the warrior-sama who protects Batland. What do you think? Won't you take me with you?
0x1338B|A child disappeared before, and the legendary hero was found.
0x1338C|It was said that a monster had kidnapped her to get rid of her. But even a monster would try to find a hero in such a way.
0x1338D|You're so stupid.
0x1338E|I'm really glad Alex came back. I keep waiting for my husband to come home
0x1338F|Ru
0x13390|I couldn't see it because it was crawling.
0x13391|It is said that strange dreams have been seen recently in the village of Imuru. Well, I think that dreams are mostly wonderful things.
0x13392|What?
0x13393|Manya: That's really stupid. Were you planning to kidnap the child until you find the hero?
0x13394|Torneko: "A monster would do something like that... I too would get anxious thinking about my son being kidnapped. Even if there was a reason to go back and forth, I can't forgive someone for kidnapping a vulnerable child.
0x13395|Ryan: When I think about it, I learned about that plan and set out on a journey to find the hero.
0x13396|Manya: “I keep waiting for my missing husband to come back.”
0x13397|You have a lot of patience. Manya: “If it were me, I would have my husband in three days.
0x13398|I'm sure it will be a long time coming back.
0x13399|Toruneko: ``It's nothing else at all.'' Toruneko: ``I'm also worried about things that my wife doesn't need.''
0x1339A|I'm letting it happen.
0x1339B|Ryan: Actually, Alex Dodo lost his memory on a trip and never came back. Ryan: So Alex Doo regained his memory.
0x1339C|Tano. Sena. ! Tsumakiri Taban...that was amazing.
0x1339D|Minea: They say that dreams are thoughts that enter a person's sleeping consciousness. Minea: Those strange dreams may be influenced by someone's strong feelings.
0x1339E|Manya: ``I often have dreams of being completely fucked in a casino.'' Manya: ``That was a scary dream. Even when I think about it, I get chills.''
0x1339F|Torneko: ``I don't really dream much. Maybe I sleep deeply?''
0x133A0|Bligh: Why do these strange dreams only occur in Imuru? Bligh: That's more mysterious than the content of the dreams.
0x133A1|Ryan: “Is it just a dream after the child disappearance incident...that village too?”
0x133A2|It's a place outside of town.
0x133A3|Minea: It seems like that old man wasn't a guided person.
0x133A4|Bly: "Hmph. It's no good if you're so short of breath.
0x133A5|Clift: "That old man seemed to be quite short of breath. Are you okay?
0x133A6|Ryan: ``As expected, it was a little difficult to have an elderly person as a traveling companion.
0x133A7|Manya: “Are you serious!? How dare you bring an old man like that with you?”
0x133A8|Torneko: ``I'm not good at fighting either, but it's tough to have that old man as my friend.''
0x133A9|Alina: If you're not good at fighting, wouldn't it be hard for you to travel with us? Alina: I think sometimes being cold is kindness.
0x133AA|Ryan: ``That old man is still the same as ever. I hope he has to take a breather again...''
0x133AB|Bly: "Are you sure it's okay to have such an old person as your friend? Bly: Hmm!
0x133AC|Suka What about those eyes? Are you trying to say that I'm the same way? ?
0x133AD|Panon: ``The King of Batland is Ibatland!'' Hehehe, you did a great job.
0x133AE|Minea: The castle town of Batland seems peaceful. Minea: Even monsters can't touch a strong country like this.
0x133AF|Manya: “It’s a big country.
0x133B0|Compared to something like Endor, it feels more like a desert.
0x133B1|Torneko: ``Whatever, this country doesn't have many powerful weapons.''
0x133B2|Niga: ``That's great.'' Torneko: ``Hmm. If you open a store in Butland, you'll have a good business.''
0x133B3|Oh, I'm thinking about it.
0x133B4|Bligh: The castle town of Butland is quite a splendid one. Bligh: ``...Mmmmm... What is it? There's a castle town in Santheim called Saran.
0x133B5|Clift: ``The fact that the castle town is so lively is proof that the country is well-governed.
0x133B6|Alina: ``Butland is said to be a land of warriors, so I'm sure the warriors in the royal palace are strong.'' Alina: ``That's great.'' I don't think the soldiers of Santheim would be good training partners.
0x133B7|Ryan: What do you think, Hero? What about my Batland? It's a pretty nice country, isn't it?
0x133B8|Grrrr...
0x133B9|Wow, I was surprised. It is said that there are people who collect weapons and armor from the sky and try to climb up to the sky. But is there really such a thing as a castle in the sky?
0x133BA|Minea: ``I can't believe there's such a rumor about us...'' Minea: ``If this is also spreading to monsters, then we have to be careful.
0x133BB|Manya: “Maybe people think we’re really stupid?
0x133BC|Clift: ``It's an undeniable fact that there is a castle in the sky.'' Clift: ``However, I guess you won't believe it unless you see it with your own eyes.
0x133BD|Ryan: You'd be surprised twice if you knew it was us.
0x133BE|Alex: I'm Aleks. Alex: I once lost my memory, but now I'm living happily with my wife.
0x133BF|Aleks: Hey, what a warrior! It's me, Aleks! Aleks: Thank you very much for that time!
0x133C0|Flare: "Oh? Wasn't it Alex? No, it's embarrassing...
0x133C1|Flare: Look, the stars are shining like that... Look at you! That's our star!
0x133C2|Flare: ``Oh, Mr. Ryan! Thank you very much for that! Flare: ``Right now, I'm living happily with my husband, Aleks.
0x133C3|Flare: ``It's thanks to Ryan-sama that I can be happy like this.'' Flare: ``I wonder how Ryan-sama is doing these days...''
0x133C4|Minea: “Is it just my imagination that makes me feel like that person is unreliable?
0x133C5|Manya: “I wonder what it feels like to lose your memory? Hmm, I’m interested.
0x133C6|Torneko: ``I'm jealous of how happy you look. I think I should go back to my home in Endor once in a while.''
0x133C7|Minea: “Is it just my imagination that makes me feel like that person is unreliable?
0x133C8|Bligh: Is that the pathetic man who was so frightened that he turned back into a child? Bligh: The human heart is truly a strange thing. I never thought something like that could happen.
0x133C9|Ryan: ``When I met him in the village of Imuru, he was just a kid, but he turned out to be a surprisingly solid person. Ryan: ``I'm sure he'd make Flare and the others happy.
0x133CA|Minea: ``Everyone is born with their own star on their shoulders.'' Minea: ``...That's not what I mean. That's how much I'm a star! That's embarrassing~. Oh, I can't do that!
0x133CB|Clift: ``Looks like you're in trouble. Let's get out of here quickly.''
0x133CC|Ryan: ``Hmm. I'm blushing all the time.''
0x133CD|Minea: What happened between Mr. Ryan and that woman... I won't pursue it deeply.
0x133CE|Manya: ``Ryan does a good job, too. Wasn't his wife a little dizzy?
0x133CF|Torneko: ``Hmm. Ryan-san also has a hard time putting it in the corner.
0x133D0|Alina: Since he wants to meet you, wouldn't it be a good idea to bring Ryan along?
0x133D1|Minea: What happened between Mr. Ryan and that woman... I won't pursue it deeply.
0x133D2|Manya: ``Ryan does a good job, too. Wasn't his wife a little dizzy?
0x133D3|Bligh: ``But where is her husband, Aleks?
0x133D4|Ryan: ``It's nice to be thanked by a beautiful lady.'' Ryan: ``Well, it would have been even better if it had been a single lady.
0x133D5|Lately, I feel like monsters have been gaining power over me.
0x133D6|I don't know if the Emperor of Hell has finally come back to life!
0x133D7|Did you know? About the key that opens even the bars of a prison! ? Rumor has it that the key is held by a queen in a castle somewhere.
0x133D8|Manya: What a nice key to open the iron bar! Manya: I can't believe how much trouble I've had because of that door!
0x133D9|Toruneko: ``It would be terrible if such a great key fell into the wrong hands.'' Toruneko: ``There's no need to be careful in this world.
0x133DA|Bligh: What is a queen? Is there a country somewhere that has a female king?
0x133DB|Clift: "Are you a queen...? Will a princess eventually become a queen?" Clift: "Or maybe you'll get married and that person will become the new king...Oh, I don't even want to think about it!
0x133DC|Alina: “Hmm. It must feel good to be able to swing open that barred door.
0x133DD|My brother has been through a lot of shit before, but he doesn't seem to be any worse for it. I'm sure he wants to go out and play with Pupuru again. ...Would you like to play with me once in a while?
0x133DE|Clift: “Is that what you meant?
0x133DF|Alina: ``...If I did that, I wouldn't have to inherit the throne, and it would be more comfortable.''
0x133E0|Clift: "Princess. When you're feeling lonely, I hope you'll come to me and think of Clift as your brother...
0x133E1|Alina: “It’s nice to have siblings. I’m an only child, so I wish I had an older brother.
0x133E2|Ryan: ``I think it's just right for boys to be a little too energetic.'' Ryan: ``When I was a kid, I was quite the brat, but now I'm a fine warrior.
0x133E3|Which cave should I explore next? I have to talk to Pupur!
0x133E4|Grrrr...
0x133E5|There is a household account book for this family. When you look inside, you can feel the awful way of life.
0x133E6|Torneko: "Is my son also playing dangerous games like that? Torneko: I'm a little worried.
0x133E7|Clift: No matter how young you are, the world outside of town is dangerous and full of monsters. Clift: Shouldn't you be careful not to let your child go outside alone?
0x133E8|Ryan: When I was a kid, I used to play in caves and pretend to explore.

0x136E4|Would you like to tell this person about Medal King's Castle?
0x136E5|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x136E6|Hmm... It's strange that no one can remember the contents of their dreams.
0x136E7|Apparently, when I stayed at the inn, I no longer had the dreams of Beppin-san that I used to have. If something like this happened, I would have stayed the night and looked at it... Haha. In my life, I always end up regretting things I didn't do later. I'm stupid, stupid, stupid....
0x136E8|The inn across the street is also a disaster. After all, there are people in this world who like things.
0x136E9|Welcome to Imuru Village! Not long ago, strange dreams were seen in this village, but that was all in the past. Now I can't help but wonder what that was. Kakaka Osamu Kakaka Special Kan Ryan. . Drinking alcohol while looking at the stars is the best.
0x136EA|Apparently, there is a very expensive shield handed down in the Butland royal family. I don't know if it still exists, though.
0x136EB|Hmm... No matter who stays the night, they will have the same dream... It can be strange sometimes.
0x136EC|I wonder what the old man in the underground prison is doing these days...
0x136ED|It's said that when you stay at an inn, a great Beppin-san appears in your dreams. ...I think I'll try staying there at least once.
0x136EE|You guys are Ryan's friends! ? Please tell Ryan. I wish I could go back to the castle once in a while.
0x136EF|Isn't that a little like Ryan? Most importantly, you seem to be doing well! The king was worried because he hadn't been home for a while.
0x136F0|The inn across the street is also a disaster. Wouldn't it be better to ask for lunch?
0x136F1|This is school. I'm still in class right now.
0x136F2|I came to pick up my child. I wonder if it's almost over...
0x136F3|Welcome to Imuru Village! Right now, this village is all about stories about strange dreams. It's a good idea to talk to a lot of people before staying at an inn.
0x136F4|Minea: Rosalie does appear in that dream, but it's a pretty scary dream. Minea: Does that old man understand that?
0x136F5|Clift: ``I'll only regret later what I didn't do...'' Clift: ``If I hadn't followed the princess that day, I'm sure I would have regretted it.''
0x136F6|Alina: I don't want to live a life where I later regret things I didn't do. Alina: That's why I went on a training trip and participated in a martial arts tournament.
0x136F7|Ryan: ``I feel like if he regrets it that much, I'd like to have that old man meet Rosalie.''
0x136F8|Minea: That dream was Rosalie's desire to save Pizarro, which manifested itself in the form of a dream. Minea: So now that dream has finished its purpose?
0x136F9|Manya: Oh, if I can't watch it anymore, I should have watched it one more time.
0x136FA|Alina: I see. Now that Rosalie has come back to life, the nightmare is over.
0x136FB|Ryan: So peace has finally come to this village? No, it's good, it's good.
0x136FC|Minea: ``It's said to be a treasured shield handed down in Batland, so I guess it's more than just a shield. Minea: Maybe it's what we're looking for.
0x136FD|Bly: "What? I have at least one or two hidden treasures in Santheim. Bly: Well...I think the previous king must have collected a lot of magic wands...
0x136FE|Clift: Butland is a kingdom of warriors. It's no wonder that the shield is said to be one of the royal treasures.
0x136FF|Ryan: ``This is the first time I've heard of that, but as expected of my Batland.It's a kingdom with tradition and formality.
0x13700|Minea: “I wonder if all men are like that... I don't like it.
0x13701|Manya: ``Why are you talking about the woman in your dreams when there's such a beautiful woman in front of you?'' Manya: ``Excuse me.
0x13702|You can't even touch it with your hands! Manya: ``But just because you touch me, I won't give you anything for free.''
0x13703|Clift: ``I'd rather have a dream about a princess than a dream about a beautiful stranger.'' Clift: ``Of course, in my dreams, the princess and I are...'' Clift: ``...Aww. Please pretend I didn't ask you about that!''
0x13704|Ryan: ``Hmm. If that's the case, then I'll have to try staying at an inn. Ryan: ``Oh, no. It's not because I want to dream about beautiful women, it's about dreams that confuse everyone.
0x13705|It's to find out about your body.
0x13706|Ryan: He's a warrior like me who serves Batland. Ryan: It seems like he's now in charge of protecting this village from monsters.
0x13707|Minea: They say dreams are when a person's thoughts enter the consciousness of a sleeping person. Minea: Maybe those strange dreams are influenced by someone's strong feelings.
0x13708|Torneko: ``I don't really dream much. Maybe I sleep deeply?''
0x13709|Bligh: It's like a dream, and it's such a peaceful village that it's such a big deal.
0x1370A|Ryan: Weird dream? I never heard of anything like that when I came here before.
0x1370B|Panon: ``Imur is a nice village. If I could live in a place like this, my life would be so long.'' Panon: ``...I'm sorry! Oh, I shouldn't have said that!''
0x1370C|Minea: For some reason, I feel a mysterious power in this village. Especially around that inn...
0x1370D|Manya: ``It's a rather boring village.'' I don't think a plain place like this is a stain.
0x1370E|Torneko: "When you come to this area, it seems like you've traveled a long way. Torneko: "But when you look at the map, this place is surprisingly close to Lake Nava. It's a strange feeling.
0x1370F|Bligh: I've heard that there was an incident in this village where children disappeared before. Bligh: The culprit in that incident was a monster... Bligh: I wonder if people in my Santoheim were also wiped out by monsters?
0x13710|Clift: ``It's a nice, peaceful village.'' Clift: ``It's probably because the nearby warriors of Batland are protecting this village.
0x13711|Alina: ``I heard there was a child abduction case in this village before.'' Alina: ``I can't forgive someone kidnapping a child! If it were me, I would punish the culprit.''
0x13712|Ryan: There was once an incident in this village where a child disappeared. Ryan: The incident was solved, but now that I think about it, that incident was the reason I started traveling.
0x13713|It is said that all the guests who stayed at this inn until recently had the same dream. Then, before I knew it, I stopped dreaming... When I came to, I could no longer clearly remember the contents of my dreams.
0x13714|I heard that you can have strange dreams at this inn, so I came all the way...! When I stayed there, I couldn't have that dream anymore! Punpun!
0x13715|I was so relieved that I finally stopped having those strange dreams. Then, I was teased by a customer who had come to see that dream... Ah, I'm so grateful for that dream!
0x13716|{7f4c} fell into a deep sleep... It seems like I'm starting to dream...
0x13717|No matter how hard I clean my nephew every day, no one will come to the bathroom. Ah, the rice that appears in my dream is so strong!
0x13718|Whenever I stay here, I keep having the same dreams. Oh that's creepy!
0x13719|In fact, when they stay at my inn, they seem to have strange dreams. Thanks to you, the customers feel refreshed... Hohoho.
0x1371A|A used towel is hanging on the wall. When I touched it with my hand, it was a little damp...
0x1371B|A fresh, clean towel is hanging on the wall.
0x1371C|<NAME> put his hand in the bathtub. Surprisingly, the bathtub was filled with water, not hot water! Is it something to cool down your hot body after taking a bath?
0x1371D|Manya: ``That's a strange way of speaking.I wonder what language it comes from?''
0x1371E|Bligh: It's strange that everyone forgets the contents of their dreams. Bligh: Well, maybe you'll be happier if you don't remember dreams like that.
0x1371F|Ryan: Well, dreams tend to be forgotten quickly. Ryan: I often feel frustrated because I can't remember the details of my dreams.
0x13720|Minea: ``What would that person do after seeing that dream? Minea: I don't want them to come into contact with Rosalie's desperate message just out of curiosity.
0x13721|Torneko: ``Oh my gosh. The world just won't stay the same.''
0x13722|Alina: There are people who have the free time to come all the way just to see that dream.
0x13723|Manya: ``There are some people who don't follow me.I feel like if I get close to them, bad luck will spread to them.''
0x13724|Torneko: ``Oh my gosh. The world just won't stay the same.''
0x13725|Bly: Rosalie, I'm sure you have no idea that your dreams are making the innkeeper unhappy. Bly: Let's keep this to ourselves.
0x13726|Alina: There are people who have the free time to come all the way just to see that dream.
0x13727|Ryan: ``Hmmm. You're really not paying attention. I feel a little sorry for you.''
0x13728|Minea: The sins committed by humans turned a young demon tribe into a demon that destroys people. Minea: What a sad story. What we are fighting against is the very sins of humans.
0x13729|Manya: ``Hey, this morning's dream had some serious content. Manya: But I don't bully Rosalie, and neither do many other people. Manya: So I can't accept that you're going to be destroyed for that reason. I'll fight resolutely!
0x1372A|Torneko: Just like Pizarro fought for Rosalie, I will only fight to protect my family. Torneko: Yes, that's all...
0x1372B|Clift: ``Humans driven by greed, and demons who seek revenge even if it means destroying themselves for love.'' Clift: ``I no longer know which is right...''
0x1372C|Alina: Oh my god... Did humans choose the fate of destruction with their own hands? Alina: No. I won't let that happen! I'll definitely stop Pizarro!
0x1372D|Ryan: ``I sympathize with that person, but we humans can't stand still and be destroyed.'' Ryan: ``As long as Despisarro is trying to destroy humans, we'll have to fight with our lives, too.''
0x1372E|Bligh: It's a sad thing, but humans make mistakes. Bligh: And I guess only humans can correct those mistakes. Bligh: What about <HERO>? We have to stop Despisarro at all costs.
0x1372F|Minea: ``From that dream, I felt the strong feelings of an elf girl.'' Minea: ``It seems to be related to the purpose of our trip, and I would like to meet her if possible.
0x13730|Manya: ``The man who appeared in my dream was pretty cool, wasn't he?'' Manya: ``But from the looks of it, it seems like the two of them are going strong...'' Manya: ``Ah, ah. Most good men are already sold, aren't they?
0x13731|Torneko: ``In my dream, the sound of the flute that the man was blowing... strangely echoes in my ears.It doesn't seem to be a bad thing.''
0x13732|Clift: What was that dream you had this morning? Clift: It made me feel deep sadness and strong prayer...I can't believe it was just a dream.
0x13733|Alina: The man who appeared in that dream said his name was Despisaro! Alina: Despisaro... That's an unforgettable name. It's not just a dream after all.
0x13734|Ryan: That person named Pizarro said he would destroy humans. Ryan: Look! This Ryan will definitely defeat the evil demons!
0x13735|Bly: ``Hello, did all of you <HERO> have that dream? Bly: Hmm. How strange that we all had the same dream!
0x13736|Panon: ``I see. It certainly looks clean.'' Panon: ``Maybe that guy is a professional at cleaning floors?
0x13737|Manya: ``That's a strange way of speaking.I wonder what language it comes from?''
0x13738|Manya: You've never confessed that to us, the travelers...Manya: Honest people are bad at business...huh? Does that mean that Torneko is a successful person?
0x13739|Torneko: "Why not take advantage of the fact that you can have strange dreams? Torneko: "In business, it's important to change your way of thinking.
0x1373A|Bligh: ``Hmph. Just whine. This inn itself has no charm, so there will be no customers.
0x1373B|Alina: ``I feel sorry for you. It can't be helped, so let's just stay here, even if it's just us.''
0x1373C|Ryan: ``Hmmm. You're really not paying attention. I feel a little sorry for you.''
0x1373D|Lately, I've been having trouble with a customer who has been complaining about not being able to dream. When I look at my child's sleeping face, I can forget all the bad things.
0x1373E|Pupuru: “Susuuu….
0x1373F|I've been having trouble staying at an inn lately. I can forget all the bad things.
0x13740|Meow.
0x13741|Good night....
0x13742|Utsura Utsura….
0x13743|I'm currently making snacks for the kids. At times like this, I somehow feel the joy of being a mother.
0x13744|Once the story of the strange dream is over, there are rumors that the Emperor of Hell will be resurrected... I wonder when I will be able to live in peace...
0x13745|Pupuru: "Me, Pupuru. Pupuru: When I stayed at my inn, I had a strange dream, but now I can't see it anymore. Pupuru: If you had come to see that dream, it would have been a shame.
0x13746|Okay, Principal. No matter what era you are in, you will never have to worry. Hey traveler.
0x13747|Just when you think the child kidnapping case is over, you're told about a strange dream... I wonder when I will be able to live in peace...
0x13748|Why do interesting things happen all the time? That's nice....
0x13749|Pupur: "I'm Pupur. Pupur: If I stay at my inn now, I'll be able to have weird dreams! Isn't it amazing!
0x1374A|Hey, are you exterminating monsters? So cool! When I grow up, I'll become a monster too... I didn't! Become a castle warrior!
0x1374B|I can't study at all because the child in front of me turns around immediately!
0x1374C|Do you know? The innkeeper Pupur has flown in the sky before! I also wanted to fly.
0x1374D|Don't get in the way of class! The children will be happy, won't they?
0x1374E|Oh no! I'll never catch it!
0x1374F|Please wait! Please wait! Oh already! Someone please catch that child.
0x13750|The principal's diary is stuck between the books. {7f4b} read the principal's diary. Children don't want to listen. It seems like they go out of the village and play around, secretly from their parents and school.
0x13751|Children's drawings are hung on the walls.
0x13752|Minea: ``Worries really don't exist in this world. Minea: Thanks to my sister, I have 10 times more worries than the average person.

0x13754|Ryan: In the end, no matter what era you're in, it all depends on how you hold your heart. Ryan: If you're like me and have a calm mind that doesn't get scared of anything, you won't have anything to worry about.
0x13755|Manya: ``You can just dance and forget about your worries.'' Manya: ``Come on, <HERO>, don't act so serious, let's dance!''

0x13757|Torneko: "......Ah, I'm sorry. I just remembered my son. Torneko: I wonder if Poporo is doing well...
0x13758|Ryan: ``That child was kidnapped by demons in a previous incident.'' Ryan: ``The best thing is that she seems to be as energetic as ever. Energy is the best thing for children.
0x13759|Minea: ``Worries really don't exist in this world. Minea: Thanks to my sister, I have 10 times more worries than the average person.

0x138E4|I don't blame you guys for helping Behui Min escape from prison. No, it's not a jailbreak, it's an immigration. Well, either way, he seemed to have reflected on it a lot, and I thought it was time to let him out.
0x138E5|Is that the guy in jail? I got caught trying to escape. He's a really cheeky guy. Don't think about opening the prison door just because you feel sorry for him.
0x138E6|You're such a bastard that you're escaping from prison under the guise of being an immigrant. yeah? Wait! ? Behuimin is an immigrant...oh! This is truly a Beho immigrant!
0x138E7|Be Hoi Min: ``Uh hick.'' Be Hoi Min: ``It was just a spur of the moment. I'm not going to run away with it anymore, so please let me out.''

0x138EA|This prison hasn't been used for a while, since a guy named Aleks was thrown in there a long time ago. It's peaceful, but recently there have been reports of a strange monster with many legs stealing food. I tried to catch him, but he was a fast runner. I always manage to escape at the last minute.
0x138EB|Panon: ``Oh shit! The gag was so great that I had to shit.''
0x138EC|Minea: Beho immigrants...Pup!! It's nothing. Don't worry about it...Pup!
0x138ED|Bligh: ``...What was that? It was so great that I stopped thinking.
0x138EE|Ryan: ``I guess this is what you mean by the fact that the mouth is open and doesn't close.''
0x138EF|Manya: What is that?! This is the first time I've ever seen a monster that eats and runs away.
0x138F0|Torneko: "Hmm. If it's such a strange monster, why not turn it into a show and make some money? Torneko: No, I'm sorry. It's a bad habit to try to turn everything into a business.
0x138F1|Bligh: I've lived for a long time, but this is the first time I've seen such a human-like monster. Bligh: Hmm, I think I'd like to do some research on it.
0x138F2|Ryan: ``What a pitiful monster to be caught for stealing and running away.'' Ryan: ``Are you really an acquaintance of that Hoimin? That guy was a serious Hoimin slime.
0x138F3|Minea: Behoimin...that's a strange name.
0x138F4|Manya: What is that!? It's the first time I've seen such a monster.
0x138F5|Clift: It looks gentle, but it's probably a ferocious monster. Clift: The fact that it's in prison is proof of that. Don't be fooled by its appearance.
0x138F6|Ryan: "Do you know Hui Min? But why is he in prison...?

0x1390A|{7f45}Mr. Despisaro! I defeated the hero <HERO>!
0x1390B|I can hear the voices of monsters from outside.

0x1390D|Cynthia has changed her appearance to look just like <HERO>!
0x1390E|Cynthia yelled Moshas! !

0x13910|Cynthia: You're so cute that I thought of you as my real sister.
0x13911|Cynthia: <HERO>... It's been a lot of fun playing with you so far...
0x13912|Now run away... and become stronger <HERO>! Got it!
0x13913|<HERO> received a large bag and a monster encyclopedia!
0x13914|Listen carefully <HERO>. The monsters' aim is your life! The monsters are in trouble for you. You have a hidden power. One day, I'll be strong enough to defeat any evil person. But you are still weak. Just run away and survive! Okay! I'll give this to you! I'm sure there will be times when it will be useful.
0x13915|Pissarro: ``I destroyed this village based on my beliefs. I don't think I did anything wrong at all.'' Pissarro: ``But I can understand the sadness of losing something precious. Now that I've lost Rosalie once...
0x13916|Torneko: ``You, <HERO>, were able to survive the monster attack safely.
0x13917|Bligh: If the Emperor of Hell returns, towns and villages all over the world will look like this.
0x13918|Clift: I don't know what to say... This is the first time I've seen a village attacked by monsters.
0x13919|Alina: If HERO looks like that and looks depressed, I wonder if everyone in the village where they died will be sad in the afterlife. Alina: That's why they seem to be doing well. Hey!
0x1391A|Minea: I can't see it, but I can feel it. <HERO> was truly loved by the people of the village.
0x1391B|Manya: That's terrible... The house is a mess! So, were the villagers safe? Manya: I'm sorry, I heard something stupid...
0x1391C|Ryan: ``How painful. This is the hometown of all the heroes...I understand how you feel.''
0x1391D|It seems like the time has finally come for <HERO>. I've been keeping quiet until now, but we are not your real parents. I would like to talk in detail, but I don't have time right now... Hurry up and hide!
0x1391E|Damn! You monsters! Have you finally located <HERO>'s whereabouts? If I have a little more time, I'll raise my <HERO> to be a great hero! Follow me <HERO>!
0x1391F|Cynthia: <HERO>! If something happens to you, I... Cynthia: Just hide! I'll be there right away too!
0x13920|We'll stop the monsters! Get <HERO> to a safe place quickly!
0x13921|It seems that the innkeeper rescued a traveling poet who was wandering on the road. That guy wanted to let people stay at the inn for business purposes...
0x13922|By the way, <HERO>. You are already 17 years old. It's about time to join the ranks of adults. Okay <HERO>. Live strong and righteously. No matter what happens...
0x13923|Oh my God! ? You ate my lunch! ? Hohoho....
0x13924|Oh <HERO>. Did you bring your lunch?
0x13925|Cynthia: "I love this village! I love <HERO> too! Cynthia: "That's why we'll be together forever. <HERO>.
0x13926|Cynthia: Good morning <HERO>. It feels so good lying like this. Cynthia: Hey <HERO>. I hope we can stay like this forever even when we grow up. Cynthia: I've been having dreams lately. I dream that we'll grow up and live happily ever after in this village...
0x13927|Wahahaha. You let your guard down <HERO>. Sword training is tough.
0x13928|So cute!
0x13929|Hmm, that's right. In order for <HERO> to leave the village, it must become even stronger.
0x1392A|But the time is not yet. You still don't have enough power right now.
0x1392B|This is the entrance to the village. They're keeping watch to make sure no suspicious people come in. By the way, <HERO>. Do you want to go outside the village?
0x1392C|Whoa <HERO>. Do you want a walk? It's nice weather today.
0x1392D|Actually, a traveling poet has wandered in... I broke the village's rules and ended up helping him. I hope it doesn't become a source of trouble...
0x1392E|Hoho…. Were there children like you in this village? I'm a traveling poet. I got lost on a mountain path and ended up in this village. But to think that there was a village like this deep in the mountains... I was totally surprised.

0x139CE|Hey there, <HERO>. Today, I'm going to teach you the Raidain spell! I'd like to go, but it seems like you're hungry...Okay! Class starts after eating!
0x139CF|Wan wan wan!
0x139D0|Lucia: ``Wow. Dogs are so cute. I want to live with a dog too.''
0x139D1|Torneko: ``That's a big deal. That dog is fulfilling its role as a guard dog.''
0x139D2|Clift: Wow, I was so surprised! I thought I was going to get bitten. Dogs are really scary.
0x139D3|Ryan: ``Phew, it's dangerous, it's dangerous. It suddenly jumped at me and I almost cut it down.''
0x139D4|Torneko: ``It seems like it would be inconvenient to live because it's far from town.
0x139D5|Manya: ``I'm tired. Hey? Let's take a rest in this hut today.
0x139D6|Minea: ``It seems that there are a lot of people who live in remote areas and are difficult.
0x139D7|Alina: ``It's not a bad idea to stay in the mountains and spend time in a hut like this for training.
0x139D8|Ryan: ``Is there something special about living in such a lonely place?
0x139D9|Wan wan wan!
0x139DA|What is that? You say I'm a kind man, even if my language is bad? Don't stop! If your ass is itchy!
0x139DB|Hey, how long have you been sleeping? Get out now!
0x139DC|What, you again? ? Hmph! An old man like you should stay the night!
0x139DD|What, you again? ? Hmph! Beppin like you should stay the night!
0x139DE|What, you again? ? Hmph! An old man like you should stay the night!
0x139DF|What, you again? ? Hmph! A girl like you should stay the night!
0x139E0|What, you again? ? Hmph! A kid like Teme should stay the night!
0x139E1|There's a lot of stuff in the pot in that room, so take it with you!
0x139E2|Wait a minute! What's your look? ? You can't travel like that!
0x139E3|What is it? Hey! Is it about traveling? As you can see, this is a woodcutter's house. Even so, I'm really tired. Hello, I hate you, you idiot brat! Hurry up and get off the mountain, kid! If you go to the southeast, there's a castle!
0x139E4|Clift: When I get embarrassed, my head starts to itch, not my butt.
0x139E5|Manya: ``Ah, you're turning red. You're a shy guy, aren't you?''
0x139E6|Torneko: Well, I guess it doesn't really mean that your butt is itchy like you say.
0x139E7|Minea: ``You must have a very strange constitution that your butt gets itchy when you're embarrassed.''
0x139E8|Ryan: ``I'm embarrassed to say something like that...'' You really are a clumsy person.
0x139E9|Hoffman: ``That old man looks a bit like me back then.'' Hoffman: ``If you live deep in the mountains without talking to anyone, your language will naturally get worse.
0x139EA|Lucia: “Wow. I haven’t fallen asleep yet.
0x139EB|Minea: ``Is it because it's embarrassing to ask Sunao to stay the night that's why you get so rude?
0x139EC|Manya: ``Ah, I slept well! I don't like his mouth, but the old man is not a very kind person.
0x139ED|Torneko: ``It's strange for you to say something like this after staying with me, but you're a bit of a bad-tempered person.
0x139EE|Alina: ``Yesterday I was put to bed right away, so I couldn't do my daily routine of push-ups!

0x14118|It is a statue of a warrior who protects the tower. It is chipped here and there, probably because it has been exposed to the elements for many years.
0x14119|Lucia: ``It's so cool to have a tower built in the middle of a lake.
0x1411A|Minea: ``There's nothing left to do here...I have a feeling like that.''
0x1411B|Manya: ``This tower is fun to look at from the outside. Manya: It's such a cool place to go out of your way to go inside and fight monsters.
0x1411C|Torneko: Ryan: Some say that the monsters here were exterminated a long time ago... Torneko: Is there any point in entering this tower now?
0x1411D|Bligh: But what was the purpose of building a tower in the middle of a lake like this?
0x1411E|Clift: From the outside, it looks like a beautiful tower nestled in the middle of a lake... Clift: When you go inside, it looks like it's been destroyed by monsters.
0x1411F|Alina: ``I had high hopes because you can't get in without a balloon.'' Alina: ``Looks like there aren't any strong monsters in this tower. I don't see any signs of that.
0x14120|Ryan: This tower is where kidnapped children were once held. Ryan: At that time, they used flying shoes to enter from the top of the tower.
0x14121|Warrior Ribasto was a great man. Many years ago, when this town was attacked by monsters, he fought to protect it... Then, he fought with the last monster and died. It is thanks to Mr. Ribasto that this town is what it is today.
0x14122|This is the armor said to have been worn by the warrior Ribast. This armor is said to have a very mysterious power hidden within it.
0x14123|Sister: ``Okay. Now, please go inside.
0x14124|Sorry, sister. I'd like to show that to someone traveling.
0x14125|If you go all the way south from here, you'll find the port town of Conanberry. If you want to go to another continent, you should take a boat from there.
0x14126|It is adorned with gaudy, glittering armor.
0x14127|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x14128|There is an old book written ``In Search of the Magic Wand, Chapter 1''. I picked up {7f4b} and read it. My name is Madrue. A magician from Lake Nava. However, he has now abandoned his homeland and is serving the Santheim royal family. This memo is my personal record of my journey in search of the magic wand at the behest of King Santheim. ...And since it's so personal, I'm going to be careful not to let anyone involved with Santheim know about it.
0x14129|Minea: But why did the monsters target this hot spring town? Minea: Was it just a coincidence, or was there a purpose behind it?
0x1412A|Manya: ``The warrior Ribasto is a delicious guy, fighting off the last monster like he was aiming for.
0x1412B|Torneko: "No. That was a really heart-wrenching story. Torneko: "Sacrificing yourself to protect the town is something that someone like me would never be able to imitate.
0x1412C|Arena: ``I'll do it, Warrior Ribasto. If I were still alive, I would have liked to have made a deal with you.''
0x1412D|Ryan: "I risk my life to protect the town...The man named Ribasto is Kagami, a warrior.
0x1412E|Cleaning up after meals is hard! Please don't get in the way.
0x1412F|Once upon a time, a traveling merchant named Torneko came to this town. He said he had a lot of money and was planning to buy a boat. Wow, he was an amazing person.
0x14130|Hmmm, that's scary... A ghost is coming... Grrrr...
0x14131|Some people say that ghosts appear in graveyards. I wonder if it's true....
0x14132|Hoffman: Come to think of it, I've also heard rumors about a merchant named Torneko.Hoffman: He was the one who spent his own money to build the tunnel between Blanca and Endor.Hoffman: There are definitely people on a big scale in this world.
0x14133|Minea: I heard that this merchant named Torneko has a shop in Endor. Minea: So what is the purpose of going on a dangerous journey?
0x14134|Manya: ``Wow. It would be reassuring to have such a wealthy person in your group. Manya: ``Then, use that money to buy up all the coins in the casino and exchange them for prizes!''
0x14135|Minea: "A graveyard ghost? I'm a little curious. Would you like to go see it at night?
0x14136|Manya: ``There's no such thing as a ghost. Let's stay away from the graveyard at night.''
0x14137|Clift: If that's true, then I'll show you how to get rid of God.
0x14138|Ahhh. There are no customers, the shops are closed, and I don't even think about going to the hot springs.
0x14139|Ah! Were you a customer? If so, please say so.
0x1413A|Wow~ There aren't many people who buy weapons in a hot spring town like this, so I'll do it in my free time...
0x1413B|No, you can't come in. If you want to go shopping, please talk to me from outside.
0x1413C|It's a beautiful starry sky. I feel like I could write a good song on a night like this. La la la la~.
0x1413D|Ribast: ``Well, you're my armor! Ribast: ``Good. I'll give it to you. Please save the world!
0x1413E|I am Warrior Ribasto. My armor was called the armor of the sky. Ribasto: But someone stole my armor and took it somewhere. Ribasto: Traveler. Please find my lost armor...
0x1413F|Hey, do you want to join us too? We're both women. Oh, you have surprisingly small breasts. Do those breasts resemble your father's?
0x14140|Yay! I'm going in now, so go over there. It's naughty.
0x14141|Oh, the warrior Ribasto~ The one who wears the shining armor ~ Fighting monsters and dying in battle Ribasto~ ♪ ...Mmm. I'd like to write a song praising the warrior Ribasto, but I'm having trouble.
0x14142|Hmm. I was shown around and shown Ribasto's armor, but it seemed like normal armor. I wonder if it was replaced at some point...
0x14143|By the way, have you decided where to stay today? If you haven't yet, I highly recommend this inn as it's friendly and cheap! Well then, I'll excuse myself here.
0x14144|And this is Anair Hot Springs. A soak in the hot springs will wash away all the fatigue from your trip.
0x14145|And this is a church... There's a great treasure here.
0x14146|As you can see, what lies ahead is a graveyard. The great warrior Ribasto, who saved this town, is sleeping here.
0x14147|This is the tool shop. I don't have anything that could be a souvenir from my trip.
0x14148|Lined up there are weapon shops and armor shops. It's a good idea to prepare your equipment here.
0x14149|Okay, then come with me!
0x1414A|That's a shame! By the way, this inn is not good, so you should avoid it.
0x1414B|Hey hello. Is this your first time in this town? In that case, should I guide you?
0x1414C|If you go all the way south from here, you'll find the port town of Conanberry. If you want to go to another continent, you should take a boat from there.
0x1414D|Have you seen the armor in the church yet? That's amazing!
0x1414E|Ah, it looks like it's coming back to life. My son brought me to this hot spring... It's a blessing to be a master of the arts.
0x1414F|Welcome to the hot spring town of Anail! Please rest your tired body after a long journey in the hot springs.
0x14150|It is marked as the tomb of the warrior Ribasto.
0x14151|Manya: It seems like you've been given an incredible responsibility with just one piece of armor. Manya: You're supposed to save the world.
0x14152|Clift: I'm sure all the Rebusts are relieved now. Clift: Great warrior, rest in peace...
0x14153|Ryan: “Rebust. We will surely carry out your will!”
0x14154|Arena: "Good for you <HERO>. The armor of the sky is now officially yours.
0x14155|Minea: I wish someone could tell me who took it and where... Minea: Now, I don't know where to look.
0x14156|Manya: “Hey! It’s gone! It’s a ghost! I saw it!
0x14157|Torneko: "Is it the armor of the sky? As an arms dealer, I'm drawn to it. What kind of armor is it?...
0x14158|Bligh: Ghosts are scary. They won't get beaten up for having a bad conversation with you, right?
0x14159|Clift: In order for Ribasto to return to heaven, he must find the armor of the sky.
0x1415A|Alina: I don't believe in anything I can't shake, but ghosts really exist.
0x1415B|Lucia: ``Huh? Breasts? Humans are concerned about strange things, aren't they?
0x1415C|Hoffman: “What can I say? I hope you stay strong!”
0x1415D|Toruneko: ``I feel like I heard something I shouldn't have heard...'' Toruneko: ``Let's just keep this to myself.''
0x1415E|Bly: But that girl. Don't you care about us who were behind you?
0x1415F|Clift: I didn't hear anything! I didn't hear anything!
0x14160|Alina: ``It's okay. It doesn't matter. Even if your breasts are small.'' Alina: ``If they're too big, they'll get in the way when you fight.
0x14161|Torneko: "It's so much better to be in the middle of getting dressed than to take off all your clothes. Torneko:...Is there something wrong with me?
0x14162|Bligh: Oh my god. It's poisonous to this old man's eyes.
0x14163|Clift: “I didn’t see it! I didn’t see anything!
0x14164|Ryan: ``Huh. I was shown something really good...'' Ryan: ``...Oh, no. Please pretend you didn't hear what I just said!
0x14165|Panon: ``Hmmm, I'll do it! I can't admire that poet.
0x14166|Minea: “Maybe that person is better suited to be a comedian or something rather than a poet?”
0x14167|Manya: “Rebust killed in battle…I don’t think so.
0x14168|Hoffman: Hmm. If that armor is fake, where can I find the real one?
0x14169|Minea: I agree with that person too. I think that Ribasto armor is just normal armor.
0x1416A|Ryan: ``I thought that armor was suspicious, too.'' Ryan: ``A first-class warrior naturally has a good eye for the weapons and armor he wears.
0x1416B|Minea: ``...my sister could do it.''
0x1416C|Manya: "Hmmm. There's no one out there who's bad enough to replace the legendary armor. Manya: But if it sells well, I might do it too... Just kidding. Just kidding.
0x1416D|Lucia: “Huh…. My eyes are spinning as I spin around.”
0x1416E|Panon: ``A nainai guide is a little boring! ...Oh! Isn't this good?
0x1416F|Hoffman: ``I see! There are other ways to attract customers.'' Hoffman: ``I've learned a lot from traveling.
0x14170|Minea: What kind of person was the warrior Ribasto? Minea: I didn't feel anything from the armor, so maybe it wasn't that big of a deal...
0x14171|Manya: ``I've already seen what I can see, so all I have to do now is take a bath in the hot springs.'' Manya: ``It's too much trouble to stay at an inn, so just decide on that.
0x14172|Torneko: ``Despite the differences between a weapon shop and an inn, as a merchant, I am humbled by your efforts.
0x14173|Bligh: I feel like Ribast's armor has a fishy smell to it. Bligh: I couldn't sense any magical power from that armor.
0x14174|Alina: ``Oh, that was interesting!'' Alina: ``You're such a kind person, not only showing me around town, but also introducing me to an inn.
0x14175|Ryan: What is that? I guess you were just trying to attract customers to your inn after all.
0x14176|Clift: “<HERO>-san is surprisingly stingy.
0x14177|Clift: ``Then let's do that. It's important to never forget gratitude.''
0x14178|Clift: As a thank you for showing me around town, would you like to stay there tonight?
0x14179|Hoffman: When I think about it, I also put my father through a lot of trouble. Hoffman: When I get home, I think I'll bring my father to this hot spring...
0x1417A|Minea: ``Ah...why don't you just leave here for now?''
0x1417B|Torneko: ``My parents died of an epidemic before I could become a full-fledged person. Torneko: If they had lived, I could have given them a much easier life...''
0x1417C|Bligh: I'm jealous. I don't even have a son who is filial to me. Bligh: All I have is a difficult princess and a traveling companion who is like a baby chick.
0x1417D|Manya: <HERO> What are you doing? It doesn't make me happy to see the old man naked.
0x1417E|Lucia: Could the strange smell that's hanging over this town be poisonous gas? Lucia: Hey, everyone. It's dangerous here! Let's get out of here quickly!
0x1417F|Panon: ``Anail has an older sister!...It's a cliche. It seems like she hasn't been feeling well lately.
0x14180|Hoffman: ``This is a famous hot spring town. If my parents had a hot spring there, it would be even more lively.''
0x14181|Minea: ``I don't like hot springs. I just can't like the smell...''
0x14182|Manya: ``Yay~ It's a hot spring! A hot spring! We have no choice but to go into this, right?
0x14183|I also stopped by Toruneko when I was on a trip to Tete and Tete. Torneko: ``It was really hard to travel all by myself and fight monsters.
0x14184|Bligh: ``Recently, my chronic neuralgia has gotten worse.Bligh: I'd like to take some time here and soak in the hot springs to heal.
0x14185|Clift: ``This sulfur scent...When I smell it, I feel like I've come to a hot spring town.''
0x14186|Alina: ``I'm not a big fan of hot spring towns.'' Alina: ``It's boring just taking a bath, isn't it?'' Alina: ``Moving your body is more fun than that. For example, doing grappling!
0x14187|Ryan: Is it possible that the hot springs in this town are mixed bathing? Ryan: Well...well, that's it. It's nice to take a relaxing bath in a hot spring once in a while.

0x14273|The hot springs must have been really nice. Look, you look so comfortable sleeping.
0x14274|Susuuu….
0x14275|Once in a while, I came to this town with my father to show my filial piety to my parents.
0x14276|It is said that bathing in the hot springs here will make your skin beautiful. But what should we do if it gets any prettier? I'm in trouble.
0x14277|Minea: "I can't believe you haven't forgotten your purpose! I can't see through my tears...
0x14278|Manya: My filial duty is to defeat Kataki and erase the secret of evolution from this world.
0x14279|Hoffman: When I think about it, I also put my father through a lot of trouble. Hoffman: When I get home, I think I'll bring my father to this hot spring...
0x1427A|Torneko: ``My parents died of an epidemic before I could become a full-fledged person. Torneko: If they had lived, I could have given them a much easier life...''
0x1427B|Bligh: I'm jealous. I don't even have a son who is filial to me. Bligh: All I have is a difficult princess and a traveling companion who is like a baby chick.
0x1427C|Ryan: It's natural to cherish your parents, but these days people like that have become less common.Ryan: Even though the world is in turmoil, it's completely disrespectful.
0x1427D|Minea: ``Why do people get in trouble if they become even more beautiful? Minea: I don't understand how people who are that beautiful feel.
0x1427E|Ryan: ``Hmm. I'm a little curious about how clear your skin will be. Ryan: ``Oh, no. This is a pure inquisitive spirit, not a lewd one.
0x1427F|Manya: “If this happens, we'll just have to take a hot spring bath and see how effective it is. Manya: <HERO> would be interested, right?

0x14580|Hoffman: Let's go!
0x14581|Patricia: “Heheen!
0x14582|Hoffman: ``This is my horse, Patricia. Everyone please pet her.''
0x14583|The desert stretches far into the distance. Without a horse-drawn carriage, it would be impossible to cross this vast desert.
0x14584|Heheheen.
0x14585|Minea: If you want to cross the desert, it seems like your only option is to somehow get a horse-drawn carriage.
0x14586|Manya: ``There's no way you can cross the desert on foot!The punch line is that you'll fall down and dry up.''
0x14587|Minea: ``If I could use this carriage, I could easily cross the desert...''
0x14588|Manya: He's a gentle horse. Will he come with us if we give him a carrot?
0x14589|Alina: ``I think I'll be able to improve my legs by running around on the sand.I guess I'll give it a try right away.''
0x1458A|Ryan: Wait, Patricia was kept here?
0x1458B|Clift: Even if there was an inn in such a deserted place, it doesn't seem like it would attract many guests.
0x1458C|Manya: When I came here, I remember when I helped Hoffman, who was upset, reform his mind.
0x1458D|Manya: “I guess it’s no good. I guess I’ll just walk too…”
0x1458E|Manya: “Huh? It’s really okay. But it’s also bad that I’m the only one taking a break, so I’ll be disappointed.
0x1458F|Manya: I don't want to walk, so can I stay in the carriage?
0x14590|Hoffman: ``From now on, I will continue to live my life valuing my faith in others.
0x14591|Minea: "The desert as far as the eye can see. Will our journey end here..." Minea: "No, we can't let it end. Yes.
0x14592|Manya: ``I can't stop! There's sand in my hair and it's getting stiff.''

0x1470F|Beyond this desert and heading south is the port town of Conanberry.
0x14710|My son seems to have recovered, so thank you very much. Please take care of my son. Before my son became a recluse, he had a dream. My plan was to study under old man Hirtan, a famous merchant. It's a dream I almost gave up on, but now that I've recovered, I want my dream to come true this time.
0x14711|Hoffman: "Let's go!
0x14712|Hoffman has joined the team!
0x14713|Hoffman: "What, in that cave! It's ironic, isn't it? I believe in the place where I was betrayed by my friend..." Hoffman: "No, wait! Hoffman: If I had believed in my friend back then, the outcome might have been different from what it is now..." Hoffman: "That cave was a testing ground to test my faith. The precious treasure was the hearts of people who believed in each other! Hoffman: I was wrong! Okay, let's start by believing in you guys. Hoffman: Would you please make me your friend? Of course, we'll take the carriage too!
0x14714|Hoffman: ``Oh, why? When I look at this gem, my heart seems to be cleansed. Maybe it's my faith...'' Hoffman: ``Where did you guys get this gem?
0x14715|{7f33} handed {7f17} to Hoffmann.
0x14716|Hoffman: What is it, you!? Oh? What is that jewel?
0x14717|I'm in trouble. I thought I could cross this desert by horse-drawn carriage. That's the owner...
0x14718|Have you met the owner of the carriage? He's my only son. He and his friends once went to the eastern cave. But then Patricia the horse came back with that bloody thing on her back... Since then, he has stopped trusting people at all. What happened with my friends in the cave? I will tell you what happened to me, my father and my father. Suohoffman
0x14719|Hofmann: ``You don't know. If you're going to go that far, I'll tell you my story.'' Hofmann: Well, I used to travel like you. Hofmann: One day, I heard a rumor about a cave where the most important treasure in the world was hidden. Hofmann: I went into that cave with my friend. Hofmann: But my best friend and I That's what I was thinking, but suddenly you freaked out on me... Damn it! Hoffman: "Damn, you just remembered something bad. I won't trust anyone anymore! Please go home!
0x1471A|Hoffman: Don't come again!
0x1471B|Hoffman: ``I'm on a journey to save the world, so please give me the carriage?'' Hoffman: ``No, no, no. It smells like a lie. I don't trust you.'' Hoffman: ``I'm sorry, but I don't want to see anyone. Go home now!''
0x1471C|Minea: "As this person said, it's impossible to cross the desert without a horse-drawn carriage. Minea: "I guess we'll have no choice but to take a horse-drawn carriage without permission...
0x1471D|Manya: <HERO> Do something. I'm definitely not going to cross the desert on foot.
0x1471E|Torneko: Speaking of Old Man Hirtan, he is a former adventurer who is now said to be the god of business. Torneko: He is also very famous among us merchants.
0x1471F|Hoffmann: ``I want to become very rich someday and make my father happy.'' Hoffmann: ``For that purpose, I have to study hard under Hirtan Roshi!''
0x14720|Minea: ``My dream is to be free from my sister. Someday, I'm sure...''
0x14721|Manya: We also went out of our way to get Hoffman rehabilitated.
0x14722|Minea: If we go to that eastern cave, will we find something that will cure Mr. Hoffman's mistrust of humanity?
0x14723|Manya: ``That's no good, dad. If you're a father, don't lecture your son as hard as a father should.''
0x14724|Minea: ``I want to curse my friend for making this person distrustful of humanity.'' Minea: ``I can't accept that we're being singled out because of Mr. Hoffman's friend, who we don't even know.''
0x14725|Manya: ``It's a treasure in the cave... If I bring it to you, will this person give me the carriage?''
0x14726|Minea: ``I don't have time to catch up. What should we do now?''
0x14727|Manya: “Manya-sama isn’t going to back down here. Look at me and I’ll ask you one more time!”

0x148A9|Before my son became a shut-in, he had a dream. He lives in a cave called Hill China, which is famous as a merchant. Once a
0x148AA|It was a dream that I almost lost, but now that I've recovered from it, I can't help it.
0x148AB|Come...
0x148AC|Ji ji. Hand east. . Let's go! Let's go!
0x148AD|Hoffman joins the team
0x148AE|It was!
0x148AF|Hoffman: What in that cave? It's ironic, isn't it? Do you believe in the place where I was betrayed by my friend? Hoffman: No, wait! Hoffman: What if I was betrayed by my friend?
0x148B0|If I believed in my friend, my back would be broken.
0x148B1|It might have come to fruition... Hoffman: "That cave was a testing ground to test your faith. Manya: The treasure was the hearts of people who believed in each other! Hoffman: "I was wrong! All right, I'm Hoffman, and let's start by believing in the house." Hoffman: "Would you please make me your friend? Of course, the carriage will be with you!
0x148B2|Hoffman: ``Ah, I wonder why. When I look at this jewel, my heart is cleansed.''
0x148B3|It seems like it's going down. Is it a heart to believe? Hoffman
0x148B4|Where did we get this gem?
0x148B5|{7f33} handed {7f17} to Hoffmann.
0x148B6|Hoffman: What is it, you!? Oh? What is that jewel?
0x148B7|I'm in trouble. I thought I could cross this desert by horse-drawn carriage. That's the owner...
0x148B8|Have you met the owner of the carriage? He's my only son. He and his friends once went to the eastern cave. But Patricia the horse came back with that bloody thing on her back.
0x148B9|hand……. Since then, he has stopped trusting people at all. He won't even tell me what happened with his friends in the cave. Irakoshin Minea Cave. Suohoffman
0x148BA|``
0x148BB|You're an ignorant person. If you're going to go that far, I'll let you hear my story. HOFFMAN: Even so, I used to travel like you.Hoffman:
0x148BC|The world's most treasured cave is said to be hidden there.
0x148BD|I heard that. Hoffman: ``I went into that cave with my friends.'' Hoffman: ``But I thought you were my best friend, and then all of a sudden you freaked out on me...damn it!'' Hoffman: ``Damn, you just remembered something bad. I don't trust anyone anymore! Go home!''
0x148BE|Hoffman: Don't come again!
0x148BF|Hoffman: ``I'm on a journey to save the world, so I'm going to take a carriage.''
0x148C0|Are you saying that? Hoffman: "No, no, no. It smells like a lie. Trust me.
0x148C1|Not really. Hoffman: Sorry to hurt you, but I don't want to see anyone. Go home now!
0x148C2|Minea: "As this person said, it's impossible to cross the desert without a horse-drawn carriage. Minea: "I guess we'll have no choice but to take a horse-drawn carriage without permission...
0x148C3|Manya: <HERO> Do something. I'm definitely not going to cross the desert on foot. Is that so? Is there anyone here? Is there a stone that was made by Hoffmann?
0x148C4|This is the person who is. Torneko: ``He is very famous among us merchants.
0x148C5|Hoffmann: ``Someday, I want to become a wealthy man and make my father happy.'' Hoffmann: ``For that purpose, I have to study hard under Hill!''
0x148C6|Minea
0x148C7|My dream is to be free from my sister. someday
0x148C8|Well...
0x148C9|Manya: We also went out of our way to get Hoffman rehabilitated.
0x148CA|Minea: If we go to that eastern cave, will we find something that will cure Mr. Hoffman's mistrust of humanity?
0x148CB|Manya: “No, you’re a father. You’re a good father, you’re a father… Think about it.”
0x148CC|Between the worlds. And don't do it.
0x148CD|Minea: “I want to curse my friend for making this person distrustful of humanity.”
0x148CE|. Minea: “It’s because of my friends that I keep believing in.
0x148CF|A song for all of us
0x148D0|I'm satisfied that I can do it
0x148D1|No.
0x148D2|Manya: “That’s the treasure in the cave... Take it.”
0x148D3|This person is driving a carriage.
0x148D4|Can you give it to me?
0x148D5|Minea: “I can’t get over it.
0x148D6|hey. What should we do now?
0x148D7|Manya: “Pull here.”
0x148D8|Down It's not Manya-sama. Watch it and ask again
0x148D9|Yo!
0x148DA|Huh? Did I meet you somewhere...?
0x148DB|Rumor has it that a man named Torneko led a caravan across the eastern desert.
0x148DC|Every night, there's an old man standing across the pond. I wonder what it is... It's creepy.
0x148DD|Utura utura....
0x148DE|The king is already asleep. Come again tomorrow morning.
0x148DF|Grrrr...
0x148E0|As I looked at the moon over the pond, I remembered a long time ago, when there lived a woodcutter and his son in the northern forest. A lumberjack's son met a beautiful girl in the forest and even got married... One day, he was struck by lightning and died. The son may have died, but the father is still working alone as a lumberjack...
0x148E1|It feels good to take a walk at night.
0x148E2|It is said that once upon a time, deep in the mountains in the north, a celestial maiden danced down. Then she fell in love with a young woodcutter, and the two had a cute baby together. picture? That baby? Ufufu I don't like it. This is bound to be a fairy tale.
0x148E3|Kururin Kururin Run Run Run….
0x148E4|Our dance is wonderful! I tried to imitate the dance style of a very popular dancer in Endor. That dancer had a younger sister, and she said they were traveling together in search of the hero.
0x148E5|It seems that a fortune teller with good results is coming to Endor, the great country of the west. I would also like to have your fortune told.
0x148E6|The king is above. King Blanca is someone who meets everyone, regardless of their status.
0x148E7|I feel really sorry for the merchant named Torneko. They say they are being targeted by monsters because they dug caves to connect countries.
0x148E8|Thanks to the cave dug by a man named Torneko, we can now go to Endor in the west.
0x148E9|This world is over! Apparently the hero who was supposed to defeat the Emperor of Hell was killed by monsters.
0x148EA|If you follow these people, you can go to many places, so it's a good idea.
0x148EB|There's nothing to be afraid of for us.
0x148EC|It seems that the hero who was supposed to save the world was killed by monsters. But don't worry. We will save the world.
0x148ED|I see... See you again then!
0x148EE|Ah, sorry! We already had a lot of friends. All you have to do is find your own people.
0x148EF|We are on a journey to defeat the boss of the monsters. Would you like to join our group too?
0x148F0|This is Blanca's castle.
0x148F1|Bligh: Wow, there's a limit to how rude you are! What kind of nonsense is it to say that just an elderly person standing there is creepy!
0x148F2|Clift: He's definitely staring at me. He's a creepy old man if you ask me.
0x148F3|Manya: That old man must be waiting patiently for the woman to take a bath in the pond!
0x148F4|Clift: What is the wife of the person who was struck by lightning doing now?
0x148F5|Alina: ``If it were me, I wouldn't get hit by lightning and die! I'm confident that I can dodge it.''
0x148F6|Toruneko: ``That's a sad story. As a parent who also has a son, I sympathize with that person.''
0x148F7|Manya: “Is the dead son’s father an old man who lives in a hut deep in the mountains?…No way.
0x148F8|Lucia: Could that celestial maiden be a person from the sky? Lucia: I once heard a story about a person from the sky who descended to the lower world and became a couple with a person from the earth!
0x148F9|Manya: If you marry someone who lives deep in the mountains, you'll have to live there forever, right? Manya: If it were me, I wouldn't like it. Because I wouldn't be able to go to the casino.
0x148FA|Ryan: If there really was a child who had the blood of a celestial maiden and a human, he would have possessed special powers.
0x148FB|Torneko: "I feel nostalgic. I hope everyone in the caravan that crossed the desert with me is doing well.
0x148FC|Minea: Mr. Torneko, who was still a rumored person back then, is now traveling with us.
0x148FD|Hoffman: ``Since we have a horse-drawn carriage, crossing the desert is a piece of cake.
0x148FE|Manya: If you want to meet Torneko, you'll have to cross the eastern desert.
0x148FF|Manya: If Torneko is being targeted by monsters, does that mean we will also be targeted by monsters? Manya: "I don't want that! Let's remove Torneko from our group! That's a lie. Don't take it seriously.
0x14900|Alina: “Even if monsters come after Torneko, I will defeat them all together!
0x14901|Clift: ``For humans, being able to connect countries is a blessing, but for monsters, it's a huge nuisance.''
0x14902|Ryan: Even if there's a monster that uses Torneko as its eyes, it'll be okay because we're here.
0x14903|Hoffman: ``I feel bad for you, Torneko, for just digging a tunnel and being targeted by monsters.''
0x14904|Minea: ``We have to catch up with Toruneko-san before she gets killed by the monsters and goes to the afterlife.''
0x14905|Alina: ``Aren't there a lot of people who say that doing business has become easier thanks to Toruneko?
0x14906|Bligh: Torneko seems to be greatly appreciated by the merchants around here.
0x14907|Torneko: I didn't dig the tunnel with my hands just to save money.
0x14908|Minea: If you continue your journey, you'll meet someone called Torneko someday. Minea: Maybe Torneko-san is also one of the Seven Lights. Maybe you're one of the Guided Ones.
0x14909|Manya: ``That's amazing, Torneko. He's rich, and on top of that, he works hard for the world and for people!'' Manya: ``Then I'll definitely have no choice but to add him to my group!
0x1490A|Ryan: If we decide that the hero is dead, the monsters might let their guard down.
0x1490B|Torneko: After all, <HERO> is the only hope in this world that can defeat the Emperor of Hell.
0x1490C|Manya: What are you talking about, this person? The <HERO> is alive and well. It's not dead!
0x1490D|Minea: This person doesn't know that <HERO> is a hero.
0x1490E|Panon: ``Oh, are you thinking of asking King Blanca for money? Panon: ``But I'm worried that King Blanca won't lend you the money!'' Panon: ``Hmm, forget about it now.
0x1490F|Hoffman: ``I used to come to Blanca often to buy things, so I came to Manya from every corner.''
0x14910|Manya: Castle Blanca doesn't have a casino or a bar, so it's a very boring place for me.
0x14911|Minea: If the only things in the castle were a store, an inn, and a church, I'm sure my sister would be quiet.
0x14912|Torneko: Considering its size, it seems like Blanka won't be able to open any more stores.
0x14913|Bligh: Santheim is more respectable than Blanca. Bligh: When a castle and castle town are combined like this, it's too poor for me to bear.
0x14914|Arena: If Santheim had a garden as big as this one, I could practice martial arts freely.
0x14915|Ryan: Is Blanca a castle and a castle town all rolled into one? It's like a fortress.
0x14916|Rumor has it that the princess of Endor and the child of Bonmor will be getting married soon. I'm jealous. Huh? wedding just now
0x14917|Are you in the process of giving it to me? circle

0x14B53|Clift: There is no prophecy that says that even if the hero awakens, he will be able to defeat the evil one.
0x14B54|Ryan: The fact that <HERO> is here proves that Blanka's legend is true.

0x14D43|Traditionally in this country, weddings last for many days. You can come see me again tomorrow.
0x14D44|The wedding is only in the daytime.
0x14D45|This is the Colosseum. This is a wedding venue.
0x14D46|When we got married, my wife was also very hot.
0x14D47|As someone who works for God, marriage is just a pipe dream for me, so I shouldn't get married... But if a nice person appears and proposes marriage, I might quit being a sister. Ah, God, I'm sorry!
0x14D48|Wick. Marriage is the graveyard of life. Kami-san, it's been cold lately...
0x14D49|Damn it! Princess Monica was the idol of us sailors.
0x14D4A|The man next door is so noisy...
0x14D4B|That’s it! ! Ruru Ruru Ruru Ruru! Ah, that's so frustrating! Look! Hold me by the shoulders!
0x14D4C|But how long will this wedding last?
0x14D4D|Ah, I want to get married too.
0x14D4E|Weddings are always beautiful.
0x14D4F|Toruneko: "Marriage is a graveyard? What are you talking about?" Toruneko: "Ever since I got married, I've gained weight due to happiness, and my stomach has become this big.
0x14D50|Minea: I don't care if I'm in the graveyard of my life, so I wish a man would appear who would free me from my sister.
0x14D51|Bly: Yes, marriage is the graveyard of life! I'm single, so even at this age I'm still excited!
0x14D52|Manya: The scary thing about marriage is that if you marry a boring person, your life will quickly turn into a graveyard.
0x14D53|Minea: When I hear about the worries of ordinary people, I almost forget the original purpose of my trip.
0x14D54|Ryan: ``Marriage?...I'm almost at a good age, so I don't think it would be a good idea to settle down quickly.
0x14D55|Manya: I want to get married too. Someone who is very rich and who can play casinos all day and never complain.
0x14D56|Clift: “Ah, I wonder if someday Princess Alina will be able to have a ceremony like that with the prince of some other country...
0x14D57|Bri: "I won't lose. I won't lose. I'll make Princess Alina's wedding even more dazzling than this one!
0x14D58|Panon: Prince Rick and Princess Monica have gotten divorced!? Panon: Oops, that was a bit disrespectful even though it was an auspicious place.
0x14D59|Panon: Let's kill each other in the Colosseum! Panon: Oops, even though we were seated in such an auspicious place, it was rather impolite.
0x14D5A|Alina: ``I can't believe the sacred Colosseum is being used as a wedding venue.'' Alina: ``Although it's an auspicious occasion, I feel like something important has been desecrated.''
0x14D5B|Manya: “If you would at least treat me to a meal, I would come every day.
0x14D5C|Toruneko: ``I also remember my wife's wedding. Of course, it wasn't as grand as this one.
0x14D5D|Ryan: How dangerous! There aren't even a single security guard around the prince and princess.
0x14D5E|You came to see a wedding. Now, please go up to the audience seats from the stairs on the right.
0x14D5F|In the back is the waiting room for the bride and groom. No one other than relatives will be allowed in.
0x14D60|Clift: I'm sure only the best people are allowed into the waiting room.
0x14D61|Torneko: ``It's human nature to want to go in if you can't get in. ...Would you like to come in at night?
0x14D62|Ryan: ``It's no use no matter how sticky you are if you can't put it in. Let's go quickly.''
0x14D63|Manya: ``You don't understand. The basics of service is to show us the waiting room and behind the scenes.
0x14D64|Mummy... There's nothing abnormal about it...
0x14D65|Welcome to Endor Castle. The gates of our country are wide open to the people.
0x14D66|The royal wedding of Endor is famous for being the most extravagant in the world. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, so you should definitely check it out. I'm sure it will impress everyone.
0x14D67|If so, enter the castle through the doors on the left and right.
0x14D68|Did you come to see the wedding?
0x14D69|Torneko: If you were to shout in the ear of a sleeping soldier, he would be very surprised.
0x14D6A|Bly: The quality of soldiers in Endor is low. There are no soldiers in Santheim who fall asleep.
0x14D6B|Ryan: ``That's outrageous. It's disgusting that someone in charge of guarding a castle falls asleep!''
0x14D6C|Manya: ``Well, let's take your wallet while you're asleep!'' Manya: ``That's just a joke. Just kidding.''
0x14D6D|I just tried it.
0x14D6E|Bligh: You must see with your own eyes just how special Endor's wedding is! Bligh: Eventually, I'll be able to attend the princess's wedding.
0x14D6F|Kinrunonou.
0x14D70|Alina: ``It's boring to watch weddings anyway.
0x14D71|Minea: ``It seems like they've turned the Colosseum into a wedding venue, so maybe it's a private venue.''
0x14D72|Manya: “I watched the wedding here before I even met the <HERO>. Manya: “Oh, the <HERO> really wanted to see it.”
0x14D73|Don't worry, I'll follow you properly.
0x14D74|Clift: “A castle looks great with a castle gate.
0x14D75|Ryan: Well, just like Butland, Endor Castle is surrounded by a moat.
0x14D76|Minea: To the castle's colosseum
0x14D77|Kan. You can see a beautiful wedding ceremony.
0x14D78|Manya: The wedding is still going on, so I don't think I'll be able to meet the king. I think I'll be able to meet him at night, though.
0x14D79|Grrrr...
0x14D7A|I didn't expect him to come into the castle this late at night! Now that I've discovered it, I can't remain silent. Sasa, leave!
0x14D7B|Oh my, the old man's nonsense has started again.
0x14D7C|If you want to go to the Colosseum, just go straight down this hallway and go down the stairs.
0x14D7D|It seems that somewhere in the world, the Emperor of Hell is being resurrected.
0x14D7E|I heard that there is a large desert far to the east of Blanca. And beyond the desert, in the port town to the south, they even sell boats.
0x14D7F|The princess had someone she liked... But I'm glad I was able to marry that person.
0x14D80|Unfortunately, the king here is rash and does what he thinks right away. But I think this marriage is the right thing to do.
0x14D81|Above this is the king's room.
0x14D82|A large picture is displayed. It appears to be something that conveys the history of the kingdom.
0x14D83|Alina: I'm a princess too, but instead of marrying the person I love, I'd rather have a fighting rival!
0x14D84|Bligh: Prince Rick and Princess Monica were in love without anyone around them knowing about it. Bligh: In that case, it wouldn't be at all strange if Princess Alina already had a crush on him.
0x14D85|Manya: How did Princess Monica and Prince Rick meet? Maybe through Nenwave?
0x14D86|Hoffman: ``Someday, I want to become a great merchant who can own many large ships.
0x14D87|Minea: We may need a ship that we can use freely on our future journeys.
0x14D88|Manya: ``If it's a town that sells boats, there's probably going to be a big casino.'' I'm getting excited.
0x14D89|Torneko: I guess it was because of the king's imprudence that I was given permission to open a shop.
0x14D8A|Minea: I can't count the number of times I've had fun because of your rash actions...
0x14D8B|Manya: In my case, making a decision on the fly often ends up working out better than if you think about it carefully.
0x14D8C|Ryan: As a soldier, you have to keep your composure when everyone is excited about the wedding. Ryan: The soldiers here are generally very good, guarding the castle.
0x14D8D|Clift: The whole castle is lively, probably because the weddings are going on.
0x14D8E|Alina: ``I wish they'd hold a martial arts tournament instead of a wedding.I remember going in and out of the castle many times before the wedding, carrying goods on my back.
0x14D8F|Minea: Ah, another bad memory. No, it's not that big of a deal, but... Minea: Once, my sister and I snuck into a castle in the middle of the night, and we were mistaken for stealing something.
0x14D90|Manya: I've been in Endor for quite a long time, so I know everything about this castle, inside and out.
0x14D91|The king and princess are already on vacation.
0x14D92|According to old books, the Emperor of Hell is a creature that has achieved the ultimate evolution. It is said that its ability was so great that the gods sealed it away as something that should not exist in this world. In other words, it was a creature that deviated from the theory of evolution.
0x14D93|Have you come to see the king? But my king is attending a wedding now.
0x14D94|This is the throne room. Please do not run recklessly or shout loudly.
0x14D95|There is a book called ``The Wonderful Colosseum.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Our Colosseum in Endor was built by the current king. It is popular among the people for its martial arts tournaments and various other events planned by the king. Bloody, meaty, dancing battle! A play full of dreams and romance! All entertainment is at the Colosseum!
0x14D96|There is a book called ``Secret Exchange Diary.'' I picked up {7f4b} and read it. Cute Monica. I thought of you 50 times today. The centerpiece of your breakfast, the pillars of the castle, the cat in the garden, the fish in the pond, and the grass on the roof all look like your face. The world is full of Monica! Good luck Monica! This diary is, as always, a secret, with love.
0x14D97|Minea: "No, sis! If you think about difficult things in your mind, you'll get a fever and collapse.
0x14D98|Manya: ``Since you've achieved the ultimate evolution, that means you're extremely large and extremely heavy, right?
0x14D99|Lucia: Even the king has more fun watching the princess's bridal outfit all day than working.
0x14D9A|Torneko: ``The king is not here, so I feel sorry for those who have urgent matters for him.''
0x14D9B|Ryan: ``It's surprising that even the king shows up to the wedding every day.What will he do when it's such a big deal?''
0x14D9C|Manya: ``The king is also obsessed with the wedding, forcing his duties on the minister.I wonder if it's okay like this.''
0x14D9D|I need to wipe the table clean. Sesse Sesse.
0x14D9E|Monica: Rest in peace... Father, I'm sorry... Rest in peace...
0x14D9F|Ri: Monica... I love you... Grrrr...
0x14DA0|King: ``Ah, ha! I never expected the princess to get married so soon.'' King: ``There's no place for me to sleep anymore.
0x14DA1|Now I have to clean it up. Sesse Sesse....
0x14DA2|Please pick it up! This is the king and princess's dressing room.
0x14DA3|There is a high quality painting on the wall.
0x14DA4|Ryan: ``You have a beautiful sleeping face.
0x14DA5|Bly: ``She's a good princess who cares about her father. I wish Princess Alina would respect her father a little more...''
0x14DA6|Manya: ``Being able to make mistakes while sleeping is an amazing skill! The problem is that it doesn't reach the other person.''
0x14DA7|Ryan: “You’re sleeping soundly.”
0x14DA8|I guess he's tired from his wedding.
0x14DA9|Alina: ``Looking at this person's sleeping face makes me sleepy.''
0x14DAA|Clift: "I'm sure we talk about love even in our dreams. I'm jealous...
0x14DAB|Manya: “Even though you’re newlyweds, you’re sleeping all the time. Could this be a sign of a breakup?”
0x14DAC|Clift: ``King Endor is such a kind person that he laughs off even the hard things for the sake of his daughter's happiness.''
0x14DAD|Hoffman: ``The king of this country is tough. He stays on his feet at night and attends weddings during the day. He never has time to sleep.''
0x14DAE|Manya: He's the king, so he should just have a bed brought in here or whatever.
0x14DAF|Clift: ``That's too much. Just talking to him makes me take him back! I didn't do anything wrong.''
0x14DB0|Ryan: ``She must be quite a strong girl to speak out so clearly when I'm so scared.'' Ryan: ``I'm a little nervous.''
0x14DB1|Torneko: ``When I'm told not to go in, I feel like going in even more. ...Why don't you come in at night?''
0x14DB2|Manya: ``What a rude girl. Go into the wardrobe room.
0x14DB3|I never said anything about scavenging.

0x152EC|As expected, the wedding between the princess and the prince was gorgeous. I also wanted to have a wedding like that.
0x152ED|Did you go to the casino in the basement? Well, I made a profit today. Wahahaha.

0x152F1|Manya: ``I want to have a wedding, but first I need to find a partner.Is there anyone who seems rich?''
0x152F2|Bri: When Princess Alina gets married, it will be as grand as Endor's.
0x152F3|Minea: "No! Don't let your sister talk about casinos. You'll be broke again.
0x152F4|Bligh: ``You can't just go into a casino with a princess in tow. Casinos are the first step to becoming a delinquent.''
0x152F5|Manya: ``Come on, let's go to the casino! I feel like today we can make up for what we lost last time.''
0x152F6|Ryan: ``The last time I came to this country by myself, the casinos were closed, so I'd like to have some fun.

0x15475|Even if the world is destroyed, our love will last forever... It'll make you cry.
0x15476|As expected, the wedding between the princess and the prince was gorgeous. I also wanted to have a wedding like that.
0x15477|Did you go to the casino in the basement? Well, I made a profit today. Wahahaha.
0x15478|It is a very good thing that the princess of Endor and the prince of Bonmor got married. In times like these, we should at least avoid conflicts between people...
0x15479|Clift: ``The next time I'm reborn, I want to be reborn as a prince.'' Clift: ``If I can, I want to be a prince right now. If I do that...haaaah.''
0x1547A|Alina: "Rather than a grand wedding, I'd rather have a grand martial arts tournament!
0x1547B|Manya: ``I want to have a wedding, but first I need to find a partner.Is there anyone who seems rich?''
0x1547C|Bri: When Princess Alina gets married, it will be as grand as Endor's.
0x1547D|Minea: "No! Don't let your sister talk about casinos. You'll be broke again.
0x1547E|Bligh: ``You can't just go into a casino with a princess in tow. Casinos are the first step to becoming a delinquent.''
0x1547F|Manya: ``Come on, let's go to the casino! I feel like I can make up for what I lost last time today, and since the casinos were closed when I came to this country on a quest, I'd like to have some fun.
0x15480|Mummy... Thanks to the monster, the armor is selling well and selling well... Heh heh.
0x15481|After the monsters showed up, all the armor was sold out and the store was closed for a while. With the purchase from Endor, we are finally able to resume business.
0x15482|Entry into the castle is prohibited at night. You can come again tomorrow.
0x15483|The King is attending Prince Rick's wedding. Come again another day.
0x15484|I raised Prince Rick. I pray that you will become a great king...
0x15485|Princess Monica of Endor is said to be as beautiful as a celestial maiden. Speaking of Celestial Maidens, there seems to be a legend in the far eastern country of Blanca. It is said that a celestial maiden who fell from the sky fell in love with a young woodcutter, and eventually became pregnant. If that's true, what happened to the child?
0x15486|I used to desperately buy armor here, but there's no longer a need for that. From now on, you can import as much armor as you want from Endor! Good thing I did it.
0x15487|It is a statue of a goddess with a benevolent smile.
0x15488|Books on imperial studies and history books are neatly lined up.
0x15489|Minea: It's a romantic legend about a young man on earth and a celestial maiden falling in love. Minea: But why do such stories always end in tragedy?
0x1548A|Manya: Customers often tell me that I look like a celestial maiden when I dance. Manya: When I dance? Does that mean you can't do that normally? That's so bad!
0x1548B|Torneko: ``It's true that Princess Monica was like a celestial maiden. Prince Rick is a happy man.''
0x1548C|Clift: If that legend is true, why did the celestial maiden come down to earth?
0x1548D|Alina: ``It's true that Princess Monica was very feminine and beautiful.'' Alina: ``I think I can understand why she's compared to a celestial maiden.
0x1548E|Ryan: ``It's an interesting legend about an angel's child. Who is that child?
0x1548F|Bligh: Is this the legend of a celestial maiden who descends from the sky? We have to go to Blanca! Bligh: Well, now that I think about it, the hero was from near Blanka. Bligh: Don't you think you have something in mind?
0x15490|Panon: ``I'm selling three steel swords at Bonmor!'' Huh? Isn't it interesting?
0x15491|Hoffman: Two countries on the verge of war are brought together by believing in each other... Hoffman: After all, it's a wonderful thing to believe in others!
0x15492|Minea: If there had been a war, both this country and Endor would have suffered great damage. Minea: I admire the wisdom and insight of the King of Endor who avoided war.
0x15493|Manya: "As expected, this country is plain and boring compared to Endor. Manya: Most of all, I don't like the fact that there's no casino. There's a casino!
0x15494|Toruneko: ``En, it was actually me who sent you the letter from the prince of this country.'' Toruneko: ``I never imagined that you would get married because of that letter.
0x15495|Bly: Rumor has it that King Bonmor is an ambitious man who was planning to attack Endor... Bly: But looking at the current state of this country, I don't see the slightest hint of that.
0x15496|Clift: After all, when it comes to dealing with the princess of Endor, you have to be a prince or something to get a good match. Clift: And it's the same with my Santheim... God, what should I do!
0x15497|Alina: ``I'm glad Princess Monica of Endor got married to the person she really loves.'' Alina: ``I also worked hard at the martial arts tournament.
0x15498|Ryan: ``It's a small castle. If monsters attacked, there wouldn't be a single place left.''
0x15499|Welcome to the castle of Bonmor.

0x15693|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x15694|Huh... I can't help but live in prison with so many shoes! Before that, I was in prison. The Bakota guy who was my partner back in the day...I wonder what he's up to these days?
0x15695|This is a prison. If you don't want to go to jail, just leave.
0x15696|Manya: ``It's Bakota! Thanks to that guy, how much trouble did I have to endure? Manya: ``Ah, just remembering it makes me angry!''
0x15697|Bligh: ``Well, that time I was forced to dress up as a nureginu, and I was in a terrible situation.Bligh: Even if I wanted to forget, it was a very unpleasant memory that I couldn't forget!
0x15698|Alina: ``That Bakota guy was quite strong, wasn't he? Alina: ``It would be a shame to leave him as a thief. I wish he had become a fighter...''
0x15699|Ryan: When you think of Bakota, you mean those bandits from Gardenburg! Ryan: After all, they're two villains. They have a strange connection.
0x1569A|Lucia: Um... what kind of place is this? Lucia: There are so many people... Oh! Are they going to do some sort of spectacle?
0x1569B|Panon: “Gokurou-san is patrolling the prison again today! It’s so painful being arrogant!
0x1569C|Minea: When I come to a place like this, I remember when I was arrested at King Leo Castle. Minea: Standing in front of my father's Kataki... I'll never forget the pain I felt at that time!
0x1569D|Manya: ``It's kind of smelly in there. That's why I don't like prison.''
0x1569E|Torneko: ``I once rescued someone who was captured here.'' Toruneko: ``Well, I was really nervous that time.''
0x1569F|Bligh: ``What a very strict guard. My Santheim should learn from your example! Bligh: Of course, I'm keeping an eye on the princess who is trying to escape from the castle, not the prisoner.
0x156A0|Clift: The prison is extremely empty, but I'm sure the prince pardoned the prisoners as a wedding present. Clift: Hate sin, but don't hate others. Let's do God's will.
0x156A1|Alina: ``This prison is huge. Are there really that many bad people in Bonmor?
0x156A2|Ryan: It's a very well-guarded prison. It would be impossible for the prisoners to escape.

0x1581F|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x15820|Huh... I can't help but live in prison with so many shoes! Come to think of it, that Bakota guy who was my partner back when he was a thief... I wonder what he's up to these days?
0x15821|This is a prison. If you don't want to go to jail, just leave.
0x15822|Manya: ``It's Bakota! Thanks to that guy, how much trouble did I have to endure? Manya: ``Ah, just remembering it makes me angry!''
0x15823|Bligh: ``Well, that time I was forced to dress up as a nureginu, and I was in a terrible situation.Bligh: Even if I wanted to forget, it was a very unpleasant memory that I couldn't forget!
0x15824|Alina: ``That Bakota guy was quite strong, wasn't he? Alina: ``It would be a shame to leave him as a thief. I wish he had become a fighter...''
0x15825|Ryan: When you think of Bakota, you mean those bandits from Gardenburg! Ryan: After all, they're two villains. They have a strange connection.
0x15826|Lucia: Um... what kind of place is this? Lucia: There are so many people... Oh! Are they going to do some sort of spectacle?
0x15827|Panon: “Gokurou-san is patrolling the prison again today! It’s so painful being arrogant!
0x15828|Minea: When I come to a place like this, I remember when I was arrested at King Leo Castle. Minea: Standing in front of my father's Kataki... I'll never forget the pain I felt at that time!
0x15829|Manya: ``It's kind of smelly in there. That's why I don't like prison.''
0x1582A|Torneko: ``I once rescued someone who was captured here.'' Toruneko: ``Well, I was really nervous that time.''
0x1582B|Bligh: ``What a very strict guard. My Santheim should learn from your example! Bligh: Of course, I'm keeping an eye on the princess who is trying to escape from the castle, not the prisoner.
0x1582C|Clift: The prison is extremely empty, but I'm sure the prince pardoned the prisoners as a wedding present. Clift: Hate sin, but don't hate others. Let's do God's will.
0x1582D|Alina: ``This prison is huge. Are there really that many bad people in Bonmor?
0x1582E|Ryan: It's a very well-guarded prison. It would be impossible for the prisoners to escape.
0x1582F|Customers... please don't break things in other people's homes too much.
0x15830|Recently, monsters have become stronger, so many castles seem to be buying weapons and armor. But how useful are ordinary weapons and armor against evil monsters?
0x15831|Prince Rick is able to get married thanks to an arms dealer. A royal marriage and an arms dealer, Yuihado said, ``Is it true?
0x15832|Torneko: That arms dealer is actually me. Did I mention it already?
0x15833|Bly: ``I can't believe that an arms dealer is involved in a marriage between members of the royal family...'' Bly: This smells like some kind of conspiracy!

0x159F5|Minea: ``I feel guilty that you would take the treasure stored in the tomb.'' Minea: ``If you're going to hit me with a drumstick, please do it only to your sister...'' No, it's nothing!

0x15A02|I...I am a Santheim soldier who was guarding the shrine on the other side... My Princess Alina said that a person named Despisaro was suspicious... Ugh, I can't move anymore. Oh, King...Princess, please be safe!
0x15A03|Clift: That soldier... Is he okay on his own?
0x15A04|Alina: The key to everything is Despisarro. Alina: For the sake of your father and that soldier, let's capture Despisarro as soon as possible!
0x15A05|Ryan: ``Oh, that's nostalgic. When I was traveling in search of the hero, I stayed at this inn.
0x15A06|Manya: ``It's really a dirty place. But maybe there's a nice, wild man hiding in a secret place like this!'' Manya: ``What? That can't be true. Huh, that's boring.

0x16012|Would you like to tell this person about <TOWN>?
0x16013|The stone statue of the wise man is cracked here and there.
0x16014|Ryan: Hmm. Why aren't there any soldiers at this checkpoint?
0x16015|Clift: "God, what will happen to our country? The king and the castle..." Clift: "At least the princess, Clift, must protect her no matter what. God, save her.
0x16016|Alina: ``...There's no one there. It's just like a castle.
0x16017|Toruneko: “The door to travel will become much easier to sell!”
0x16018|Manya: Haha. That journey door actually led to that place!
0x16019|Hey, isn't that Torneko-san? ? Were you alive? Good...yeah.
0x1601A|If you meet someone called Toruneko, the traveler will tell you that this old man was worried about you.
0x1601B|Torneko is an amazing guy who could dig a tunnel like this.
0x1601C|Leave the coins in your name at the casino! Congratulations!
0x1601D|congratulations! You are the 1000th person since this tunnel opened! Therefore, you will receive a magnificent prize from King Endor! Endor Casino Coin <GOLD>Gold
0x1601E|But! Leave the coins in your name at the casino! Congratulations!
0x1601F|This is the tunnel that connects Endor to the west and Blanca to the east.
0x16020|It's a statue of a wise man with a fierce and chaotic appearance.
0x16021|Toruneko: ``That old man was the one who worked with me to get the tunnel opened.'' Toruneko: ``I had no idea he was still living here even after the tunnel was opened.''
0x16022|Bligh: "Hmmm, casino coins? This is another troublesome thing. Bligh: You can't take the princess to the casino! Casinos are the first step to becoming a delinquent.
0x16023|Ryan: ``Oh, casino coins. Well, maybe you should play at the casino once in a while.''
0x16024|It might be a good idea to
0x16025|Torneko: "Are we the 1,000th person? Oshii: If only we had paid the toll..." Torneko: "Oops, that's just a joke. I'm not too mad about it either.
0x16026|Manya: ``I did it! What a great day today. Let's go straight to the casino now!
0x16027|Torneko: "No, Minea-san, I didn't come until you told me to charge a toll.
0x16028|Minea: Mr. Torneko must be regretting that he would have made a considerable profit if he had collected the tunnel toll.
0x16029|Ryan: ``Even though you're a merchant, you do something for people for free.'' Toruneko is a mirror image of a merchant.
0x1602A|Torneko: “I can’t believe he’s such a great guy.
0x1602B|Shisune: It's annoying to be judged.
0x1602C|Hoffman: If you're just a merchant, there's no need to dig a tunnel. Who are you, Torneko?
0x1602D|Minea: That can't be true! Mr. Torneko was the one who raised the funds to dig this place.
0x1602E|Manya: Is it true that Torneko dug this tunnel by herself?
0x1602F|Manya: “If we expand this cave and turn it into a casino, we can make a lot of money! What do you think? That must be a great idea.
0x16030|Minea: ``Before I met <HERO>, even though I asked her to go to Blanca from here, she was reluctant. Minea: ``Why? There's a casino in Endor, so she doesn't want to leave.
0x16031|Torneko
0x16032|Before I met you, I was desperately saving money to open this tunnel.
0x16033|Pizarro: ``What on earth are you trying to make me do by bringing me to a place like this?
0x16034|Minea: ``There are many things in this world that cannot be grasped with human knowledge. Minea: This is one of them.
0x16035|Manya: ``Huh...'' Looks like we have a long way to go. I'm already tired.
0x16036|Torneko: "Hmph. I can smell the treasure. I'm sure it's in the back...
0x16037|Bligh: What is it like here? Strange things have happened there.
0x16038|Clift: Hmm! There's something sinister about it. Is it okay for me to come into a place like this?
0x16039|Alina: ``It's kind of exciting! I feel like a new adventure is about to begin.''
0x1603A|Ryan: ``Exactly! It's surprising that the bottom of the hole looks like this!''

0x160D3|Clift: The old man over there... Maybe it's just my imagination, but he doesn't seem to be alive...
0x160D4|Alina: "I'm surprised! There are people living in a place like this. The world is so big!

0x16134|Alina: Huh. It would be fun to build a home in a place like this. A castle would be fine, though.
